Please place porting todo items in this file categorized by lib/module

**** cmake build system ****
  A. Need to port over all the configure checks found in configure.in.in

**** extdate ****
  A. Decide whether this lib even belongs anymore.  Will Qt4's date/time classes serve us?
  B. If we are going to continue using this should we start with Qt4's classes and revamp them?

**** libkst ****:
  A. Numerous changes WRT Qt4's threading package
    Probably should get rid of own threading classes and use Qt4's versions...
    KstRWLock -> QReadWriteLock etc, etc
  B. Revamp the plugin manager to use Qt4's plugin system?
  C. Rename kstdebug classes as they really are loggers and should be named as such.

**** libkstmath ****:

**** libkstapp ****:
  A. Get rid of KMdi* classes.  Using typedefs for now, but these need to go away
  B. NOTES on kst2dplot:
    I'm using the following mapping for QPainter::rasterOp in 3.x to QPainter::compositionMode in 4.x
      CopyROP = CompositionMode_Source
      XorROP = CompositionMode_Xor
      NotROP = CompositionMode_Destination
      SetROP = CompositionMode_Source
  C. Several places in libkstapp use QMouseEvent's combined with the info they present about the state
     of the keyboard modifiers.  This facility isn't present in Qt4 AFAIK.  The code is just commented
     out.  Grep through kst2dplot for 'stateAfter' for instance.
