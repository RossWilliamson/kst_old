Please place porting todo items in this file categorized by lib/module

**** cmake build system ****
  A. Need to port over all the configure checks found in configure.in.in

**** extdate ****
  A. Decide whether this lib even belongs anymore.  Will Qt4's date/time classes serve us?
  B. If we are going to continue using this should we start with Qt4's classes and revamp them?

**** libkst ****:
  A. Numerous changes WRT Qt4's threading package
    1. Probably should get rid of own threading classes and use Qt4's versions...
       KstWaitCondition -> QWaitCondition
       KstRWLock -> QReadWriteLock
       etc, etc
  B. Switch to using Qt4's container classes eg Q3ValueList --> QList
    1. No longer need to use QDeepCopy as all implicitly shared objects in Qt4 are reentrant and
       use atomic reference counting.  See the threading docs...
    2. KstObjectList::findTag is broken for now as Q3ValueList does not have same semantics as
       QValueList had...
  C. Revamp the plugin manager to use Qt4's plugin system?
  D. We relied upon a hack in KDE3 version that used a private header
     from qt.  This is no longer installed in Qt4.  This can be taken care of by getting rid of
     KstWaitCondition as described above.
  E. Rename kstdebug classes as they really are loggers and should be named as such.
