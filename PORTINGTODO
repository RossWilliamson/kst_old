Please place porting todo items in this file categorized by lib/module

**** cmake build system ****
  A. Need to port over all the configure checks found in configure.in.in

**** extdate ****
  A. Decide whether this lib even belongs anymore.  Will Qt4's date/time classes serve us?
  B. If we are going to continue using this should we start with Qt4's classes and revamp them?

**** libkst ****:
  A. Numerous changes WRT Qt4's threading package
    Probably should get rid of own threading classes and use Qt4's versions...
    KstRWLock -> QReadWriteLock etc, etc
  B. Revamp the plugin manager to use Qt4's plugin system?
  C. Rename kstdebug classes as they really are loggers and should be named as such.
