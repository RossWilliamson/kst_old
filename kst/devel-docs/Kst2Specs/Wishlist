Export eps to vector format.
  kst 1.x did this by printing to file a .ps file, and then modifying it by adding the bounding box.

------------

Shared axis from the command line

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

------------

Fixup line/arrow dimensions tab:
  x,y instead of length/angle

----------

Scientific notation (instead of C's %e notation) for extreme axis numbers

--------

Edit multiple for other view objects (arrow, line, label...)

--------

Edit multiple for vectors
(or get rid of the option in the dialog)

--------

data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory (QDirModel doesn't handle this...)
   (nor QDir, though QDir seems to know about $HOME).

1.x kst file read compatibility...

Thread kst2

--------------------

When you have many plots on a window (like 35), and the numbers in
the axis labels are large, they often overwrite each other (so you can't
tell any of the numbers apart).  

--------------------

in <ctrl> or <shift> zoom modes the line cursor should appear in all tied plots.

--------------------

Tied zoom icon should be a mag glass + paper clip
Replace layout mode icon with zoom icon, and invert sense

--------------------

Legends can get larger than the plot if there are enought things in them.  This should not be. 

--------

vector selectors in curve dialog can't grow when you extend the window size.

-------

Some automagic way of deciding if plugin dialogs can make plots.

Using QSharedPointer

The idea is that the live time of an object is handled externally to the object.
The usage of the object is reference counted by QSharedPointer. Maybe we don't
need the ObjectStore because in principle is only a wrapper for global variables.
Then it should be possible to remove all the 'friend class Kst::ObjectStore;' lines
(friend is not our friend.)

Use CMake build system with the option -Dkst_merge_files=1 because touching 
sharedptr.h requires a complete rebuild which is many times faster with above option.
