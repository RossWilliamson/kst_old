Compatibility Policy
--------------------

Only the necessary properties, methods, and objects will be exposed via
JavaScript.  For the most part, bindings will be provided based on user-demand.
There is a global script version number which scripts can use to determine if
they are compatible with the version of Kst they are running in.  If they are
for general distribution, they should check this.

If it is discovered that a major bug exists that makes a property, method, or
object completely unusable, it may be changed in an incompatible way.  Otherwise
we will always provide a suitable implementation of a feature that is shipped
in an official Kst release.

Code in development versions ("SVN") is subject to change at any time.

Kst v2 may break compatibility with version 1.
