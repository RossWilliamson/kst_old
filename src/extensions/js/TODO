General Completion:
- more verbose error messages (ie: which argument is wrong, and why)
- input and output map for data objects
- events and possibility to define event handlers
- collection class is read-only presently - make read-write


Would be nice:
- save and load state
- object browser GUI
- multiple interpreters?
- dump list of loaded files
- many bindings lack good [or any] bindings (ComboBox, list{view,box}, etc)
- string comparisons are too slow - at least use ustring


Docs:
- Add examples with an example node


1.2.0 issues:
- Curves are stale in concept - split them?
- No image binding
- line and arrow orientations don't fully work
- "delete" support - in order drop references?
- Make .position and .size directly manipulated?
