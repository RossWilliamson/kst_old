0) make sure you have the absolute latest kst2 from steve
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade

It hopefully will update kst2.

1) install dependencies for numpy and scipy
sudo apt-get install python python-dev libatlas-base-dev gcc gfortran g++

2) Install numpy 1.6.1
# tar xvfz numpy-1.6.1.tar.gz
# cd numpy-1.6.1/
# python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95
# sudo python setup.py install

3) Install scipy-0.9.0 +
# tar xvfz scipy-0.9.0.tar.gz
# cd cd scipy-0.9.0
# sudo python setup.py install

4) copy pykstpp.py and pykst.py into the directory where you will be writing and running your own python scripts.
(Note: this is totally lame, and will change 'soon'.)
(Note: you may want to get new versions of these from time to time until I properly fix things)

5) testing it
vectors.py and matrix.py are two test scripts that you can run to see if everything is working.
pykstpp.py and pykst.py need to be in the same directory as these scripts if you expect it to work.
