Installation Notes for Kst 2.0 Beta

Linux

1. Download or otherwise install Qt 4.3/4.4.
2. Make sure your QTDIR is set to that Qt installation.
3. Optionally update your ./config.pri has the appropriate settings for your machine.
4. ./build-kst
5. ./run-kst

Notes:
To build in debug mode debug can be added as a parameter to build-kst
ie.  ./build-kst debug
To configure the output directory, set OUTPUT_DIR or include it after the command line argument for debug.
ie.  ./build-kst release /home/kst
To enable make install support, set INSTDIR


Mac OS

Notes:

#1.  Same as the steps for Linux with some modifications required.
#2.  The qmake command line needs to be updated to include -spec macx-g++.
#3.  An error has been observed compiling view.cpp, view.h may need to be updated to change QXmlStreamWriter to QCoreXmlStreamWriter on line 45.

Windows

Note:  This has only been build using Visual Studio & Cygwin.  The following steps
are used on the current Windows build machine used for testing, but may vary.

1. Download or otherwise install Qt 4.3/4.4.
2. Make sure your QTDIR is set to that Qt installation.
3. Make sure your ./config.pri has the appropriate settings for you machine.
4. Start up Cygwin's bash shell - Required due to command line length limit in cmd.exe.
4a. Setup environment variables in Cygwin to link against Visual Studio - See qtvars.bat at end of file. It can be run as qtvars.bat vsbash to setup variables and start the shell.
5. mkdir build && cd build
6. qmake -r ../kst.pro
7. nmake
7a.  If an error occurs, you may need to update Makefile.debug and replace "CXX  = @echo compiling $< && cl" with "CXX=cl"
8. ../run-kst


qtvars.bat  - Update directories to match machine configuration.
