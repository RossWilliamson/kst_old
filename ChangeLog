2006-08-23 20:08  brisset

	* : Add initial support for metadata from netCDF files from global
	  attributes. For multi-valued attributes, only the first value is
	  used (but strings are complete and certainly the most interesting
	  kind of metadata). If there are requests for getting more values
	  it should be easy to add. Also change kdDebug() to kstdDebug() and
	  comment out debugging traces. Only failures still print out
	  something. Now George can test this and try to make metadata
	  strings usable in labels :-) I am committing directly as it is a
	  very isolated change that won't affect users without netCDF
	  support, and it is easy to revert in case of problems.

	  KstTopLevelView::pressMoveLayoutModeEndPoint similar to the one

	* : update for a design change

2006-06-03 15:13  staikos

	* : - bump the Kstfile version number to 1.3 - make the check work
	  based on double conversion - works well enough for now - only do
	  the padding hack if we have a 1.2 kstfile (were there pre-1.2
	  files that did this? script generated ones don't count) - make the
	  future-kst-files error a warning instead -> note, Kst 1.2 will not
	  load Kst 1.3 files. If this is a major problem, I'll have to make
	  a 1.2.2 release to remove the test. In retrospect it always should
	  have been a warning, not a hard error.

	  I have made a mistake.

2006-06-01 16:49  brisset

	* : Adding the shift plugin as discussed on the mailing list today.
	  It can shift forward/to the left (positive shift values) and
	  backwards/to the right (negative shift values), and truncates the
	  extra points so that the resulting vector has the same size as the
	  input vector. Missing values are padded with NaNs, which achieves
	  a nice effect: the curves really look like they are shifted (while
	  padding with zeroes could be confusing in many cases). Finally, as
	  suggested by Barth, the plugin is a filter, which means it can be
	  called directly from a plot via the RMB/Filter menu. Simple, but
	  cool :-)

2006-05-30 14:11  staikos

	* : Add a dialog that shows metadata for datasources from the data
	  manager. It's low impact here. I haven't really tested displaying
	  any data since I don't have any datasource that has metadata right
	  now. If any source plugin wants to put it into variables, it can
	  do it itself. Nothing ever precluded this. I'm not going to put
	  anything inline in the data manager because it's just too much
	  data and the horizontal scroll bar will be quite large. Also we'd
	  have to strip out many characters (and newlines). FEATURE: 120749,

	  should not be a virtual function, should take const references as
	  parameters, should use a const iterator, should not use
	  iVariables, and should be a const function. If anything in there
	  prevents fixing constness, it's probably pointing to another issue

	* : The legend dialog can be used to add or delete curves from the
	  legend. Previous to this patch, 'apply' in the plot dialog would

2006-05-05 16:31  brisset

	* : Changes to the CDF datasource, driven by the need to read CDF
	  files written by the CDF routines bundled with Matlab (which are
	  stored in a way that was not handled previously, for more
	  information see the comments in the code). It is reasonably well
	  tested here, if anybody gets a chance to test it further or takes
	  a look at the code, comments are welcome. While we were at it, we
	  cleaned up the code a bit: - indentation, especially for calls to
	  CDFlib(...) - data are read in whole chunks, while they were
	  previously read one at a time. I suppose it should be faster, but
	  I have not benchmarked it and with a few thousand samples the
	  difference is not really noticeable - frame counts are initialized
	  directly while creating the field list - the understands_cdf()
	  function now returns 100. Note that there is no locking mechanism
	  in place for the case of concurrent access from different threads.
	  I have not seen any crashes due to that (yet), but it may be good
	  to keep it in mind as I'm not sure the CDF lib is threadsafe.

2006-03-09 10:25  staikos

	* : This patch is really only partially done, but what's there works
	  and I'm hitting conflicts so it's time to commit. this starts to
	  fix the child object painting (printing) problems. There were a
	  number of bugs, ranging from using the wrong geometries, to the
	  whole "resize, restore" sequence not fully completing. This cleans
	  up some of them by using the proper parent geometry. It also
	  factors resolution enhancement out to where it belongs:
	  KstPainter. Resolution enhancement is not something that should be
	  in Kst2DPlot. it's something that the caller should request in a
	  painting sequence, and should be requested by the caller. -All-
	  objects need to be aware of it, and the only sane way to do this
	  is make it a property of the painter. Also some unnecessary draws
	  and updates were removed. With this, legend and label printing
	  (along with other objects) can be properly fixed. CCBUG: 123036

2006-03-09 04:17  netterfield

	* : BUG: 123211 Long flight - Barth gets some work done... Impliment
	  line weight settings for plot axis lines Also something perhaps a
	  little more controversial: By conventions I am familiar with,
	  weight=0 -> use thinest line availible weight=N -> use n-pt width
	  line. This is not what the line weight stuff for curves used to
	  do. Instead, the line width was some function of the size of the
	  plot. I have changed it to the above definition, and changed the
	  default line widths to 1. Kst files which stored their line width
	  as 0 will now print curves with the thinnest possible line
	  width... which is a change. thoughts? cbn

2006-03-07 17:25  staikos

	* : I need to get this patch in before I mess things up too much. It
	  renames createPlot<> to createObject<> since that's what it really

	  also fix layouting in createObject<> when we're not on a grid. Not
	  worth backporting yet.

	  but generally quite useful. 1) Invalidate labels when the
	  reference scalars/vectors/strings/expressions change. This makes
	  realtime top-level labels work, assuming the data they're pulling
	  from is updated. That part will be fixed separately and this patch
	  will be reduced as a result. CCBUG: 106307 2) Don't play around
	  with \n and \t. Our new editor supports them properly so we can
	  handle both real CR and Tab, and \n and \t. Fixes munging of
	  labeltext BUG: 122386 3) Add preliminary support for \textit{},
	  \textbf{}, \underline{} to the parser and renderer, and a stub for
	  \textcolor{}{} to the parser. In general the first three work, but
	  cannot be nested. The last one does not work yet since there is no
	  color parser. Testcases to follow once nesting is handled.

	  system to be a lot smarter: existing layout should now be
	  respected a lot more. (some of the referenced bugs were already
	  closed, but I am re-closing them). -Place plots into a window in
	  the order they are listed... Previously they would be placed
	  randomly. -If there are non-dirty plots in the window, then
	  "Default tile" guesses the current number of columns based on the
	  width of plots already in the image, rather than using sqrt(NC).
	  If there are no clean plots, then it uses sqrt(NC) as before.
	  -Keep plots in the tile position closest to the current plot
	  position. If there would be two in the same tile, move the further
	  to the next unfilled tile location. This way empty tiles in the
	  middle of the layout stay empty if there is nothing to fill it.
	  -If some of the plots have their axis supressed, resize them to
	  make the size of the plot area more approximately equal.

2005-12-22 15:05  staikos

2005-12-22 05:48  staikos

	  results in the legend being incorrectly painted

	* : if there are no curves to plot for a legend then display a blank
	  legend of reasonable size. We do not want to hide the legend as
	  then there would be no way for the user to edit the legend
	  contents

2005-12-20 20:06  arwalker

2005-12-19 18:02  staikos

	* : When transparency is turned on, set the border width to 0. use

2005-12-18 23:24  netterfield

	* : Set useful defaults to the plot dialog, in case the first use is

2005-12-18 22:06  netterfield

	* : Vector Dialog shouldn't show the legend text entry, because

2005-12-18 01:18  arwalker

	* : BUG:118148 no longer draw to the back buffer when printing an
	  autoresize label. It wastes time and messes up the repainting of

2005-12-16 21:24  staikos

	* : that wasn't supposed to go in. line loading now works

2005-12-16 21:19  staikos

	* : putting these properties in the right place (line) makes lines
	  load closer to correctly. also set dirty when the arrow changes.

2005-12-16 20:39  staikos

	* : lines are lines, not arrows

2005-12-16 19:42  arwalker

	* : BUG:118363 Allow arrows to be created in any orientation

2005-12-16 19:34  arwalker

	* : no longer crash when left click on a line or arrow end point to
	  move the end point and release without moving the mouse at all

2005-12-16 18:05  arwalker

	* : not necessary

2005-12-16 15:11  staikos

	* : kst object is now addressed

2005-12-16 14:58  staikos

	* : update docs

2005-12-16 14:58  staikos

	* : of course... that's why it throws. I hadn't set nothrow

2005-12-16 10:25  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-12-16 05:13  netterfield

	* : BUG: Lines can now be saved. Lines and arrows can now be loaded.

2005-12-15 23:15  staikos

	* : done

2005-12-15 23:07  staikos

	* : After all that debugging, it looks like the issue is that the
	  ut<->tai conversion algorithm is actually a gmt<->tai conversion!
	  That's why it was off by one hour.

2005-12-15 17:04  staikos

	* : adapt testcases to label parser behavior changes

2005-12-15 03:44  staikos

	* : make the tests compile

2005-12-15 01:11  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:118148 When printing or exporting avoid the entire
	  clipping scheme. More efficient and more elegant

2005-12-14 23:10  arwalker

	* : nicer icon

2005-12-14 23:05  staikos

	* : set nsamples properly for the case where f0 is an absolute date

2005-12-14 22:50  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:118148 Fix up some more problems

2005-12-14 22:11  staikos

	* : this was clearly wrong

2005-12-14 21:58  arwalker

	* : BUG:118148 Fixes bug with clipping while drawing curves and is
	  more efficient.

2005-12-14 21:40  staikos

	* : make time work in count-from-end mode

2005-12-14 21:33  arwalker

	* : BUG:118148 Replace QPainter with KstPainter. Will need this to
	  fix clipping.

2005-12-14 21:22  arwalker

	* : fix indentation

2005-12-14 20:08  staikos

	* : found more lurking

2005-12-14 20:06  staikos

	* : restore designer indentation yet again. Would it help if I add
	  modelines for other popular text editors?

2005-12-14 19:35  staikos

	* : fix build without healpix

2005-12-14 00:10  staikos

	* : - make argument passing to extensions work - add a new field to
	  give extensions a short-form name in the .desktop file - add
	  support for JS arguments -E js:"execute this script text" - you
	  can't i18n strings you plan to: a) store to disk and later load
	  for comparison b) compare at runtime randomly

2005-12-13 21:35  staikos

	* : I think it's fair to say this is 100% obsolete :)

2005-12-13 16:07  staikos

	* : forgot to commit this yesterday

2005-12-13 11:59  brisset

	* : Fix remaining bug. Now, it works... If only we could have custom
	  widgets in the plugin interface, this would allow for more
	  convenient filter characteristics input than transfer functions
	  :-)

2005-12-13 06:00  netterfield

	* : update

2005-12-13 05:59  netterfield

	* : ideas for relative placement of chidren.

2005-12-12 23:04  arwalker

	* : fix indentation. explicitly declare doubles

2005-12-12 21:45  staikos

	* : add a loadScript() function

2005-12-12 21:43  mamd

	* : make it compile with KDE 3.1

2005-12-12 21:41  mamd

	* : remove unused code and make it compile with KDE 3.1

2005-12-12 21:14  mamd

	* : make it compile with KDE 3.1

2005-12-12 20:52  mamd

	* : make it compile with KDE 3.1 libraries

2005-12-12 19:44  staikos

	* : has to be fixed

2005-12-12 19:17  arwalker

	* : BUG:118149 Plot identifier was changed in kst2dplot.cpp but not
	  here.

2005-12-12 19:14  staikos

	* : fix apidox

2005-12-12 18:51  arwalker

	* : BUG:118150 Set the title and modified flag correctly

2005-12-12 16:29  brisset

	* : Use double instead of long double, as it makes the filter ca 15
	  times faster (and 7 x faster than the FFT implementation) svn diff
	  kstfilter_generic.cpp! Hopefully, doubles will be enough as long
	  as filter orders are reasonable. Note that we still have an init
	  problem somewhere.

2005-12-12 11:47  brisset

	* : Fixlets; factor out a test in filter.h, but efficiency is still
	  a problem: the FFT + filtering in freq domain + inverse FFT
	  approach is almost as fast as this implementation, which should
	  not be the case. Needs further investigation (any help
	  appreciated, the only comptuationally-intensive piece being
	  :NextTimeStep() in filter.h and the main loop in
	  kstfilter_generic.cpp, line 60)

2005-12-11 06:07  netterfield

	* : BUG: 115662 Improve documentation for -F option.

2005-12-10 01:06  staikos

	* : make horizontal and vertical lines work a bit better, and don't
	  divide by zero. I noticed that saving and loading of arrows and
	  lines doesn't work.

2005-12-10 00:33  staikos

	* : This breaks arrows, and actually isn't fully correct at this
	  time, but it's close. It forces the line to be completely inside
	  the bounding box even when the width is greater than 1.

2005-12-09 19:10  staikos

	* : update release plan and list every minor fix we need in 1.2.0
	  (and some of 1.2.1). Anything else needs to be approved at this
	  point. Anything I missed?

2005-12-09 16:54  netterfield

	* : A rebuttal :-)

2005-12-09 04:59  staikos

	* : Allow objects to be created as children of other objects, not
	  just windows. Object creation is a bit unusual though since they
	  are created in invalid state if they are not off the toplevel.

2005-12-09 04:17  staikos

	* : add support for remove by index as well, though there is a bug I
	  can't track down. it works, but it throws a type error exception.

2005-12-09 03:27  staikos

	* : add prepend, remove, and clear for curve and view object lists

2005-12-09 03:03  staikos

	* : add tied property

2005-12-09 02:37  staikos

	* : 25 reasons why Kst2DPlot needs to be destroyed

2005-12-09 01:21  staikos

	* : too quick

2005-12-09 01:06  staikos

	* : make legends quite a bit more useful from KstScript, and fix
	  some buglets in the legend object

2005-12-08 22:37  arwalker

	* : do not want to indent here as we continue to save at the same
	  level

2005-12-08 22:10  arwalker

	* : remove compiler warnings

2005-12-08 07:24  netterfield

	* : Legends shouldn't follow flow, but maybe labels (at least as
	  label boxes) and boxes should. Lets play some and see what we
	  think.

2005-12-08 07:08  netterfield

	* : view legend widget now also controls alignment: vertical or
	  Horizontal.

2005-12-08 07:04  staikos

	* : - plot groups will not be touched for now, maybe removed
	  altogether from kst - document how the debuglog works

2005-12-08 07:00  staikos

	* : list properties always

2005-12-08 06:51  netterfield

	* : fix size in horizontal legend mode.

2005-12-08 06:51  staikos

	* : - give toplevelview the right name - update changelog - make
	  changelog work in srcdir != builddir

2005-12-08 06:38  staikos

	* : add missing properties margin and padding. we need to fix them
	  someday, so let's get them in (and see if anyone complains).
	  remove trailing whitespace.

2005-12-08 06:35  staikos

	* : - add baseclass for bordered view objects and expose those
	  properties - make apidox work in srcdir != builddir Note:
	  margin+padding are basically ignored by all view objects I tested
	  so far.

2005-12-08 06:32  netterfield

	* : Why not....

2005-12-08 06:31  netterfield

	* : Give padding (margins) to legends. Make margin size in labels
	  and legends relative to font size, not in pixels, so that they
	  scale.

2005-12-08 05:12  staikos

	* : make plotgroups mostly work again. they're now "non-container"
	  objects since they actually abuse the notion of containers. There
	  are lots of bugs lurking. They include: - clipping of non-plot
	  regions broken in non-transparent mode - properties are missing
	  (such as colors, borders) - axis alignment doesn't work? -
	  conceptual: no way to do graphics in groups (or group contents)

2005-12-08 03:24  staikos

	* : Remove flicker by using the same trick used in 2dplot. It needs
	  to be optimized though. Actually all the painting needs to be
	  fixed.

2005-12-08 02:03  netterfield

	* : legends respect border width.

2005-12-07 23:30  staikos

	* : fix flicker when objects are nested in plots. introduces an
	  inefficiency to be sorted out soon, or in 1.2.1 due to too much
	  clip mask computation, and some re-entrancy.

2005-12-07 23:15  netterfield

	* : use reasonable legend defaults to plot dialog. Make the legend
	  dialog work.

2005-12-07 20:54  staikos

	* : focus adjustment needs to apply to children too

2005-12-07 19:01  staikos

	* : - make new objects a child of the first containing container -
	  don't allow them to be resized out of the container - simplify the
	  mouse handlers a bit more

2005-12-07 18:39  arwalker

	* : BUG:115988 Do not assume that a datasource is going to provide
	  and INDEX vector

2005-12-07 15:14  staikos

	* : I give up with trying to make objects view-independent at this
	  point. _parent is used all over and the design depends on it now.

2005-12-07 14:47  staikos

	* : fix compile?

2005-12-07 06:56  staikos

	* : one thing I forgot to mention... Not critical, but not nice
	  either.

2005-12-07 06:30  netterfield

	* : Fill the view dialog (just the easy stuff so far).

2005-12-07 06:19  staikos

	* : Finally done :)

2005-12-07 06:16  staikos

	* : some cleanups including checking the result of the dynamic cast,
	  not the argument to it

2005-12-07 06:03  staikos

	* : it's now possible to move child objects and make objects
	  children of other objects that have the _container property.
	  Arrows, lines, labels and legends do not have the _container
	  property. The rest do. It's not perfect, but it gets us started.
	  One significant bug is that children created inside an object are
	  still parented to the top-level object until they are moved.

2005-12-07 05:37  netterfield

	* : start on activating viewlegend dialog

2005-12-07 03:48  staikos

	* : more entries

2005-12-07 02:47  staikos

	* : It's possible to select and move child objects now. However they
	  don't leave gracefully yet.

2005-12-07 02:09  staikos

	* : these are so obsolete, might as well get rid of them

2005-12-07 02:09  staikos

	* : better at least return something for now

2005-12-07 01:41  staikos

	* : some TODO items - separated for 1.2.0

2005-12-07 01:01  arwalker

	* : make sure that the curve dialog is also launched when clicking
	  near a curve when one or more axes is reversed

2005-12-07 00:28  arwalker

	* : might as well draw all sides of the rectangle

2005-12-07 00:11  arwalker

	* : ensure that we also draw something when no image is defined

2005-12-06 23:32  arwalker

	* : BUG:117821 Fix typo

2005-12-06 19:57  staikos

	* : remove virtual to deconfuse developers and add FIXME to remove
	  these functions in 1.2.1

2005-12-06 19:44  staikos

	* : two more cases

2005-12-06 19:37  staikos

	* : ?? a special case in view object for one of the classes that
	  inherits -from- it? this should fix plot saving

2005-12-06 18:24  arwalker

	* : make sure we repaint the rectangle if its transparency has been
	  changed

2005-12-06 09:15  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-12-06 05:59  staikos

	* : A relic of the KstPainter conversion BUG: 117771

2005-12-06 05:46  staikos

	* : labels are by design, rest are fixed

2005-12-06 05:45  staikos

	* : don't create a data stream if we don't need it

2005-12-06 05:37  staikos

	* : It's a bit buggy still, but dragging all view objects to other
	  applications that accept as an image works now. Also includes a
	  focus change that finds the deepest child instead of the first one
	  for mouse handling. This will be used for embedded object support.
	  The images produced by this are close, but still not quite right.
	  Plots are the right size but in the wrong location. Other objects
	  are the wrong size and in the wrong location. The image size is
	  correct.

2005-12-06 05:17  staikos

	* : allow the user to reparent/move view objects in the hierarchy

2005-12-06 04:54  netterfield

	* : Print background of labels when not transparent.

2005-12-06 04:46  staikos

	* : that was even more broken

2005-12-06 04:45  staikos

	* : funny how the case of one character can cause an hour long
	  debugging session. This makes plots appear as plots in the
	  scripting extension again, even though .convertTo() always did
	  work on them anyway.

2005-12-05 23:20  netterfield

	* : BUG: 117481 when printing, 2D plots are informed that the paint
	  type is P_PRINT...

2005-12-05 23:02  netterfield

	* : Add a custom dialog to legends... doesn't do anything yet.

2005-12-03 23:27  staikos

	  doesn't exist. BUG: 117535

2005-12-03 01:32  arwalker

	* : BUG:115969 Set y-axis to AUTO when there are only images in the
	  plot. Previously this was AUTOBORDER

2005-12-02 22:25  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:115969 Set AUTO instead of AUTOBORDER if we create a new
	  plot for our new image.

2005-12-02 21:02  staikos

	* : Create a default window on startup BUG:117535

2005-12-02 18:32  staikos

	* : fix the chopping of lines in the other two directions

2005-12-02 18:25  staikos

	* : clip the lines to the view so we don't crash. However this isn't
	  a full solution because it allows the user to create lines greater
	  than the view on the bottom or left sides. the line stuff needs a
	  bounding box

2005-12-02 17:45  staikos

	* : Stay in the right mouse mode on key press BUG: 117482

2005-12-02 17:42  staikos

	* : remove an oddity from kst2dplot (non-functional change) and a
	  stale comment

2005-12-02 17:26  staikos

	* : update the bindings documentation

2005-12-02 01:07  staikos

	* : should fix the label creation regressions introduced recently -
	  do settings before the dialog is shown.

2005-12-02 00:03  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:116442 Explicitly set fixed number of columns to try and
	  prevent a very wide widget.

2005-12-01 23:53  netterfield

	* : BUG: Num points for svectors was not being set.

2005-12-01 23:43  staikos

	* : fix doc bug

2005-12-01 23:03  staikos

	* : cancel dialog should cancel the creation in create mode.

2005-12-01 22:19  staikos

	* : fix ellipse masking

2005-12-01 22:15  arwalker

	* : fix display of large palettes

2005-12-01 22:13  staikos

	* : only show dialogs once - adds a lock. Was implemented a bit more
	  complicated so we can launch this dialog from other places
	  someday.

2005-12-01 22:06  arwalker

	* : BUG:115970 Restore data mode for images. This provides the
	  nearest data point for both the nearest curve and the topmost
	  image.

2005-12-01 21:39  staikos

	* : fix non-alpha pictures

2005-12-01 20:07  netterfield

	* : Remove completed todo item

2005-12-01 20:06  netterfield

	* : In text mode, set the cursor to |, except for drags, in which
	  case it becomes an arrow. This provides much better feedback that,
	  for example, if you click on a label, you are going to create a
	  new label, not edit the one you clicked on.

2005-12-01 18:56  arwalker

	* : BUG:115893 Ensure axis alignment occurs across groups by
	  burrowing down into groups to determine the axis alignment and
	  dirty states.

2005-12-01 18:25  staikos

	* : refactor all of the graphics handling code, and finally
	  implement view object factories. there might be some broken items,
	  but it mostly works. This somewhat fixes drag to the desktop, but
	  it's still a bit broken. Easy to fix. It also makes it possible to
	  do child-object manipulation in the near future.

2005-12-01 09:38  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-12-01 05:55  netterfield

2005-12-01 05:37  netterfield

	* : Apply defaults to new view label dialog. Click in text mode pops
	  up a text dialog in transparent, no box mode Box in label mode
	  pops up a label dialog in !tranparent, w/ box mode.

2005-12-01 01:22  netterfield

	* : Margins!

2005-12-01 01:09  netterfield

	* : Activate font selection in viewlabeldialog.

2005-12-01 00:37  netterfield

	* : Add fontColor to viewlabels, and activate it in the dialog.

2005-12-01 00:08  netterfield

2005-11-30 21:09  staikos

	* : that was not supposed to go in

2005-11-30 21:01  staikos

	* : fix all the ROP stuff by letting each object decide. the state
	  is stored in the KstPainter

2005-11-30 20:25  staikos

	* : - dewarn: Move new method implementations to the .cpp file - fix
	  bug in pulse generator: warn if trying to create a vector with the
	  same name as another one - remove some trailing whitespace all
	  over - factor out a couple of constants in kstviewobject - fix
	  transparency for pictures by using OrROP. SetROP is misbehaving. -
	  add the edit menu to the view objects and factor out some common
	  entries - remove unused files - add some checks to the picture
	  object - this breaks lines, arrows, boxes, and borders.

	* : - designer style indenting - C++ booleans - don't use

2005-11-28 20:51  staikos

	  that it is now much simpler for the typical user.

2005-11-28 04:09  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-11-27 23:04  staikos

	* : embed the custom widget if there is one. The label dialog now
	  uses the embedded dialog, but it doesn't work. It needs a .ui.h
	  with all the logic. We need to define a way to pass the viewobject
	  pointer into the dialog, or have a function in the viewobject that
	  takes a pointer to the custom widget and populates it or reads
	  from it as needed.

2005-11-27 22:29  staikos

	* : - rename the textdialog ui since it's a widget now - add a new
	  function to view objects to provide a custom widget - some other
	  minor cleanups I had lying around

2005-11-27 22:25  staikos

	* : change it too a widget

2005-11-25 20:30  staikos

	* : list more bugs

2005-11-25 20:10  staikos

	* : more KstPainter conversion, and make selection indicators work,
	  mostly.

2005-11-25 18:32  staikos

	* : - introduce KstPainter to encapsulate our painting parameters
	  and hopefully help fix the selection issue - add most consts as I
	  was adapting everything to KstPainter - make slotFilePrint
	  partially sane. it was 10 levels deep in braces and did some
	  strange things when errors happened

2005-11-25 15:04  staikos

	* : fix i18n

2005-11-25 15:01  staikos

	* : make it possible to translate to Italian, possibly others.
	  libkdeedu should also be fixed. CCMAIL: Federico Zenith
	  <zenith@chemeng.ntnu.no>

2005-11-25 04:42  staikos

	* : Selection rect can't be drawn from paint because it affects the
	  clipper. Remove for now which fixes lots of corruption. Will
	  re-add later in a different way. A couple minor cleanups. Also
	  remove a redundant check in directionFor().

2005-11-25 04:06  staikos

	* : - US english for names - reuse a painter to avoid constructing a
	  new one - move a clear up a bit

2005-11-25 03:01  staikos

	* : initialize variable, set dirty when dirty, and don't do things
	  we don't need to

2005-11-25 02:48  staikos

	* : - rename a method to what it actually does - lots more missing
	  const

2005-11-25 02:04  staikos

	* : another big const cleanup and removal of virtual function calls
	  in inner loops, found while bug hunting

2005-11-25 01:21  staikos

	* : remove a whackload of virtual function calls from various
	  functions that appeared in the past year. Factored out some
	  redundant tests, and fixed a FIXME where some code needed to be
	  converted to a switch(). Added guards on setters to avoid setting
	  dirty when unneeded.

2005-11-24 17:45  brisset

	* : Fix licence formatting; add missing lib in Makefile

2005-11-24 00:24  staikos

	* : Fix Matt's bug and basically put Andrew's patch back with the
	  bounds clipping moved into kstviewobject instead. It's a bit
	  slower, but much faster than painting regions we don't need to
	  paint. There are still issues with the guidelines, but they were
	  always there and not related to any of these bugs. Still can't
	  reproduce what Andrew sees though, so I don't know for sure that
	  it fixes it, and even then, why. BUG: 116847

2005-11-23 23:34  arwalker

	* : Fix more problems caused by previous changes to
	  Kst2DPlot::SetBorders. In particular the offsets from the axis
	  were not being correctly calculated when the offset+delta mode was
	  used.

2005-11-23 23:10  arwalker

	* : Explicitly set the rotation angle of the x-axis full label so
	  that it is never drawn at 270 degrees. This problem arises because
	  we are using the same variable for both the x-axis and y-axis full
	  label.

2005-11-23 22:33  staikos

	* : this is an ugly hack but it fixes my problem without any new
	  repaints or other side-effects that I can see. The problem is,
	  closing a popup menu with LMB over a plot causes the following
	  events in the following order: - popupmenu closes - plot gets
	  pressEvent - plot gets paintEvent (under menu) - plot gets
	  paintEvent (whole plot) - plot gets releaseEvent This patch allows
	  those paint events to pass through to the plot that received the
	  pressEvent too, not just the other plots. Does it help any of the
	  other reported paint issues?

2005-11-23 21:41  staikos

	* : add a couple new debug messages (sorry, removed the last ones in
	  viewwidget) and move the giudeline drawing out of the way of
	  EXPORT and PRINT paint events since it doesn't belong there

2005-11-23 21:32  staikos

	* : - use a guarded ptr for the menu - bail out on clicks when the
	  menu is visible - slight refactor of click handling

2005-11-23 19:54  staikos

	* : turn on debugging so we can see what's happening

2005-11-23 19:33  staikos

	* : ok that was backward

2005-11-23 19:00  staikos

	* : - data wizard time conversions were backward - enable/disable
	  the units along with the input - disable absolute time for range

2005-11-23 18:04  staikos

	* : looks like we're still on track for Dec 15, remove some

	* : substitute distance back

2005-11-22 23:44  arwalker

	* : Ensure that the resizing of newly created notation objects is
	  the same as for resizing existing notation objects. In essence

2005-11-22 23:37  staikos

	* : - move the variable where it belongs - += += += -> + + + to make
	  it faster on debug builds (check the asm if you need evidence) -
	  make it work (the first result was being clobbered) - remove the
	  lowerToBottom() again -> if you need more evidence, try without
	  this patch and do a cleanup twice. The order keeps getting
	  flipped. ( not to mention that it screws up the concept of

	  the outside of the border (borders don't get clipped) -Room is
	  made inside the border for the text in autoResize mode
	  -Left/right/top/bottom justification leaves room for the border

2005-11-22 17:47  brisset

	* : Ooops. I think PIC is needed...

2005-11-22 17:45  brisset

	* : Yet another nice plugin. That one takes two strings containing
	  the numerator and denominator filter coefficients (in continuous
	  time), discretizes the filter and computes it step by step. You
	  can input any kind of filter, even though once again it would be
	  more convenient to be able to provide a more intelligent widget
	  that would generate the coefficients according to filter type,
	  family, and order... I have not been able to test it yet even
	  though it compiles fine, as loading the .so fails for a reason
	  unclear to me (any help in understanding why some symbol including
	  polynom is undefined even though the appropriate .o was linked
	  into the .so will be appreciated). I suspect a problem in the
	  compilation or linking options (PIC ? .so or .a ? Order of the
	  objects ? The use of templates ?) Once it works, it should bring
	  nice improvements to the current filters: - should be extremely
	  fast as they compute the result directly in the time domain
	  without the need for a fft + computation + inverse fft - will be
	  causal (which is not the case right now) I provide a hand-written
	  Makefile for now, it will need to be included in the build process
	  once it works and we have time for it.

2005-11-22 17:16  netterfield

	* : Compensate for the box border width when drawing the box. The
	  extents of the box are the outside edges of the border.

2005-11-22 04:07  staikos

2005-11-22 03:59  staikos

2005-11-21 22:48  arwalker

	* : BUG:111178 Prevent labels from overlapping when axis suppression
	  is used. At present this only applies for non-rotated labels. This
	  also fixes a bug in the border positions for some cases.

2005-11-21 22:28  staikos

	* : 

2005-11-21 21:15  arwalker

	* : Correctly position the transformed x/y-axis labels. Previously
	  they would appear inside the plot axes and be misaligned with
	  respect to their opposite axis labels.

2005-11-21 20:45  arwalker

	  - activate scalar substitution flag in the labels - disable it
	  where needed in the plot object -> makes tick offsets work again

2005-11-21 10:27  brisset

	* : Small test file to play with.

2005-11-21 10:26  brisset

	* : Last fixes: it WORKS! Some details can probably still be
	  improved, but this works quite well. I will commit a small test
	  file for interested people to play with. I believe this
	  general-purpose plugin has a lot of potential, provided that
	  performance is OK (still to be thoroughly tested) as it could be
	  used for all sorts of fits, and if we have at some point in 2006 a
	  new plugin system where the GUI is more flexible, we could reduce
	  drastically the number of plugins that need to be installed. To be
	  discussed further...

2005-11-21 10:18  brisset

	* : Improved Makefile: - links to the static parser library for now
	  to avoid having to adjust LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If we prefer to link
	  against the .so (I suppose we do in the long term ?)
	  libmuparser.so will need to be installed in some place where we
	  are sure to find it. - links against gslcblas which is also
	  required - also generates the plugin's .so - ^M cleanups

2005-11-21 08:50  brisset

	* : Cosmetic improvements + default strings to make it clear what is
	  expected

2005-11-21 07:09  staikos

2005-11-17 19:10  staikos

	* : simplify and remove deadlock

2005-11-17 17:50  brisset

	* : Adding a (cool) new plugin allowing to fit arbitrary non-linear
	  expressions. This uses the muParser developed by Ingo Berg (who
	  should be added to kst credits according to the licence) to
	  evaluate the expressions. The solver used is the one provided by
	  gsl (Levenberg-Marquard algorithm, robust and efficient
	  implementation according to the doc). This plugin has not yet been
	  added to the build system as I don't really know how to do that
	  :-) I put it in a place I believe is appropriate, but feel free to
	  change it. It should only be compiled when gsl is found by
	  configure. For now, I provide a hand-written Makefile that should
	  do the job. Note that at this stage, it compiles under Linux
	  (still some problems while linking on Solaris, hopefully linked
	  with my non-standard installation) but I can't load it from the
	  plugin manager in kst for some reason I have not found out yet. As
	  a result, I have not been able to test it and I don't expect it to
	  be fully debugged. The code should be essentially complete, but
	  may need fixes. Any help in making this work will be greatly
	  appreciated :-) I don't even know whether the problem is in the
	  xml or in the code (the error message says "invalid plugin file").
	  Hopefully all features is uses (like passing strings) are
	  supported, but from I can tell looking at plugin.cpp it should be
	  the case.

2005-11-17 17:06  netterfield

	* : Briefest beginning of IO for legend label text changes.

2005-11-17 16:42  truch

	* : Allow positive numbers to start with a '+'. Sometimes, for
	  reasons no known to me, people make damn sure you don't think they
	  have a negative number by putting a + in front to mark it as
	  positive. These people have been known to work in the Spectrum
	  Analyizer division at Stanford Research Systems.

2005-11-17 16:27  staikos

	* : add a timezone changed signal

2005-11-17 14:55  staikos

	* : I think these locks are needed but they'll be expensive and

2005-11-17 00:11  staikos

	* : please don't push all variable declarations to the top of the
	  function. That's an old C-ism and the result in Kst time and time
	  again is that we have: - computations that are done but no longer
	  used and not removed since they're so detached from their
	  meaningful areas - unused variables lying around

2005-11-16 23:47  arwalker

2005-11-14 04:44  staikos

2005-11-13 01:59  tskisner

	* : Merge changes from hpic-0.52 that include more robust detection
	  and reading of FITS files containing "chunks" of a full-sphere
	  map. This format is used in some WMAP maps and others posted
	  around the web. Also modify the ang->pix conversion routines to do
	  a straight conversion at the specified nside, rather than
	  converting at the highest nside and degrading. Display speed is
	  more important than consistent round off error in this case.

2005-11-12 01:16  staikos

	  have a patch. Just keep the textfile proposal.

2005-11-11 07:57  tskisner

	* : This is the start of a patch to implement Kst2DRenderer
	  functionality. I will try to keep it up to date so that it always
	  applies cleanly against HEAD. So far I am mostly just adding new
	  files, so there are very few changes to existing code.

2005-11-11 05:39  staikos

	* : - fix some missing locking in the data wizard - add absolute
	  time input field - convert to using a double for times - add

2005-11-11 03:34  staikos

2005-11-11 00:08  staikos

	* : add libextdate from kdeedu to give us a better range. May
	  require a name change since we need this in the public API for
	  datasources. For now we might have to live with inability to make
	  datasources out of our tree.

2005-11-10 23:52  staikos

	* : update to match the new behavior

2005-11-10 21:54  staikos

	* : disable if not in use by anyone (?)

2005-11-10 00:07  staikos

	* : only need one of these too

2005-11-10 00:00  staikos

	* : one copy is enough

2005-11-09 23:32  arwalker

	* : Don't crash when adding PlotListBox in the designer

2005-11-09 23:29  arwalker

	* : Add KstComboBox to the Qt designer

2005-11-09 22:44  arwalker

	* : Replace PNG with XPM.GZ

2005-11-09 04:47  staikos

	* : apply getdata patch by Don BUG: 115645

2005-11-09 03:41  staikos

	* : redundant

2005-11-09 03:18  staikos

	* : moveLeft/moveRight fixed BUG: 115748

2005-11-09 02:39  staikos

	* : factor out calls to KPoint::dim since they all do the same thing
	  and are not entirely cheap. Should speed up error bars a bit.

2005-11-09 02:28  staikos

	* : revertlast

2005-11-09 02:21  staikos

	* : at least a temporary workaround for the error bar bug The
	  question is, what was this -supposed- to do? I can't make any
	  sense out of KstPoint::dim() and I'm not even sure why it was used
	  here. I hardcoded the value to 5. The same will need to be applied
	  elsewhere if it's OK. CCBUG: 115966

2005-11-09 02:20  staikos

	* : cleanup dead code

2005-11-09 02:17  truch

	* : width + height / 400 != (width + height) / 400 BUG: 115966

2005-11-09 01:42  staikos

	* : remove unused object

2005-11-09 01:25  staikos

	* : get the bindings for legends working again

2005-11-09 00:50  staikos

	* : shrink the icons BUG: 115967

2005-11-09 00:40  staikos

	* : fix docs

2005-11-08 22:17  mueller

	* : the usual "daily unbreak compilation". Its getting tiring

2005-11-08 20:49  netterfield

	* : KstViewLegend is now created and edited by the plot dialog and
	  data wizard, and main.cpp KstLegend has been deleted. The binding
	  to the old legends has been bypassed. Still TODO: -save and load
	  -load old format -edit dialog -non-default names -escaping of _
	  etc in default names -optimize

2005-11-08 16:05  mueller

	* : the usual "daily unbreak compilation"

2005-11-08 09:51  brisset

	* : Make less verbose; replace kdDebug() with kstdDebug()

2005-11-08 08:47  amantia

	* : Visibility fixes. Finally kst compiles and links.

2005-11-08 04:58  truch

	* : Install the newly added LGPL license, as well as turn off
	  verbose setup (quiet).

2005-11-08 04:17  staikos

	* : disable this class

2005-11-08 04:11  staikos

	* : some cleanup while hunting the KRecentFilesAction bug

2005-11-08 02:06  staikos

	* : remove plugin editor

2005-11-08 02:05  staikos

	* : disable compile of the plugin editor

2005-11-08 01:33  staikos

	* : add lgpl and update doc

2005-11-07 16:20  staikos

	* : remove dead code as a result of no-longer needing a symbol font.

2005-11-07 06:46  netterfield

	* : Make 'latex math' symbols work in labels: \alpha to \omega,
	  \sum, \int, \pm \le \ge \ne \approx \inf etc. The symbols are
	  pulled from the current font's upper tables. A separate symbol
	  font is no longer needed.

2005-11-07 02:11  tskisner

	* : Remove autoscale buffer- it is annoying in some circumstances

2005-11-06 22:08  tskisner

	* : More additions to the healpix testcase.

2005-11-06 22:04  tskisner

	* : Make sure to load the current datasource parameters (not just
	  the saved, per-file global config) when initializing the config
	  widget.

2005-11-06 21:57  tskisner

	* : Enable workaround for full-sphere FITS files that do not use
	  1024E wide columns like normal. Some of the WMAP files are notably
	  like this. Also add checks for vectorfield degrade factor to make
	  sure we cannot degrade past nside=1.

2005-11-06 20:06  staikos

	* : fix label parser bug

2005-11-06 18:18  staikos

	* : Fix rename of tabs also, and cleanse whitespace. Someone's
	  editor is leaving stray whitespace all over the place. You can
	  clean this up with: s/\s\s*$//

2005-11-06 18:02  staikos

	* : remove the rest of the kdebug.h, some cleanup, and add some
	  missing locking. please note: copying a global list is no way to
	  circumvent locking.

2005-11-06 17:40  staikos

	* : remove another kdebug.h

2005-11-06 17:38  staikos

	* : fix X zoom max (typo by me?) and cleanup unused variables and
	  code BUG: 115746

2005-11-06 17:14  staikos

	* : some cleanup and make Close in the context menu close the
	  window, and close the -right- window BUG: 115749

2005-11-06 08:11  netterfield

	* : Another point for the ViewObject Fixme..

2005-11-06 07:20  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-11-06 05:59  netterfield

	* : forgot this...

2005-11-06 05:38  netterfield

	* : Fixes required to the view object UI. Comments craved.

2005-11-06 02:21  netterfield

	* : Update PlotUI definition.

2005-11-06 00:41  tskisner

	* : This patch seems to work for me. I can load local files and urls
	  from the commandline and the saved kst file always has either the
	  url or the full path. Comments welcome...

2005-11-05 21:43  staikos

	* : some more that were done, and opaque resize is definitely too
	  slow

2005-11-05 17:50  netterfield

	* : Delete obsolete or completed items from this basically
	  depricated doc.

2005-11-05 17:04  netterfield

	* : Make view legend rendering work.

2005-11-05 14:37  staikos

	* : found testcase that crashes the label parser

2005-11-05 06:29  tskisner

	* : Actually, this is broken as well. What if I do kst -x 1 -y 2
	  someotherdirectory/data.txt? I am reversing this for now- need to
	  query the absolute path to the datafile.

2005-11-05 06:22  tskisner

	* : Currently, if you use kst from the commandline to view some raw
	  data and then save the result to a new kst file, the filename tag
	  gets set to the relative name, *NOT* the absolute path of the data
	  file. If you then go to another directory and try to open the kst
	  file from there, kst crashes. This patch prepends the current
	  working directory to the relative name when loading the
	  datasource, so that the behaviour is consistent with data files
	  loaded from the GUI.

2005-11-05 05:50  tskisner

	* : Always save kst file parameters in the currently selected
	  coordinate system. Change internal numbering of the coordinate
	  systems so that current kst files will be compatible with the
	  future inclusion of other coordinate systems. Move all necessary
	  hacks to config widget save/load functions.

2005-11-05 05:16  tskisner

	* : Make sure to use RA/DEC as external default when loading/saving
	  config. When saving config, remember to swap theta min/max when
	  exporting the internal values, which are in radians.

2005-11-05 01:16  netterfield

	* : More legend work... not even close to done yet.

2005-11-05 00:17  staikos

	* : add a few testcases (that aren't verified automatically)

2005-11-04 23:56  staikos

	* : dewarn

2005-11-04 21:57  tskisner

	* : Add trivial reset function to healpix datasource. The healpix
	  datasource does not actually read a file until a call to readField
	  or readMatrix, so this function does nothing currently.

2005-11-04 21:42  tskisner

	* : Have healpix testcase check for its calling path in order to set
	  the path to the example data file. Add testcase to the
	  runregression script.

2005-11-04 21:10  tskisner

	* : Beginning of healpix testcase.

2005-11-04 17:32  staikos

	* : C++ify (delete null is valid)

2005-11-04 17:31  staikos

	* : update the clip rects after drawing a graphic. Yuck. There's no
	  reason the graphics export code should kill the cache for the
	  display code and force a redraw. We need to fix the whole
	  export/print mechanism. BUG: 115663

2005-11-04 17:20  netterfield

	* : The basecurves hold the parsed legendlabels.

2005-11-04 17:17  staikos

	* : Add a match X axis tool - will reorganize menu later possibly.
	  FEATURE: 115664

2005-11-04 07:24  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-11-04 01:37  netterfield

	* : ViewLegend should be based on ViewLabels, not ViewBoxes.... But
	  - it shall soon be heavily hacked (ie, nothing to see here...)

2005-11-03 21:47  staikos

	* : make sure the define is there on older KDE installs

2005-11-03 21:18  staikos

	* : add license and missing include

2005-11-03 07:18  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-11-02 15:56  staikos

	* : Fix solaris build. This will work at least until I can determine
	  if kdefakes is an option for us

2005-11-02 02:00  netterfield

	* : ViewLegend starts to exist... but doesn't do anything yet.

2005-11-02 01:25  tskisner

	* : This is such a small change that anyone can change it back if we
	  really need to keep the "-m" option.

2005-11-02 01:18  tskisner

	* : Modify slightly the numbering of fields. Also allow using fields
	  named 1, 2, 3, etc that specify the field number. This is required
	  for supporting commandline loading of healpix FITS files. You can
	  now do things like: kst -M 1 healpix.fits.

2005-11-02 00:14  tskisner

	* : remove matrix checks from functions that are only called from
	  the paint function. If these get called, then we have already
	  checked for the matrix.

2005-11-02 00:04  tskisner

	* : Ok, hopefully this is all correct now...

2005-11-01 23:31  tskisner

	* : kst files use absolute paths, so this file will not help the
	  rest of you very much...

2005-11-01 23:27  tskisner

	* : Always make sure we have a valid KstMatrix before trying to
	  access or paint it. This fixes the crash on loading a KstImage
	  from a kst file.

2005-11-01 22:47  tskisner

	* : Revert previous change

2005-11-01 22:10  tskisner

	* : Remove debug statements and do internal name change for vector
	  components.

2005-11-01 22:06  tskisner

	* : Beginning of healpix tests. Start with an example FITS file and
	  a corresponding kst file to play with.

2005-11-01 21:47  tskisner

	* : Add support for saving/loading a healpix image from a kst file.

2005-11-01 21:45  tskisner

	* : When loading an image from a kst file, it will crash unless we
	  actually load the matrix into _inputMatrices when parsing the Dom.
	  This fixes the problems I was having when saving a healpix image
	  (or simply trying to save/load the example asciimatrix.txt image)

2005-11-01 21:32  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-11-01 21:26  staikos

	* : implement setTimezone

2005-11-01 21:09  staikos

	* : variables aren't slots

2005-11-01 21:05  staikos

	* : unused

2005-11-01 20:59  staikos

	* : add --without-netcdf BUG: 115167

2005-11-01 20:34  staikos

	* : enable-final seems to work now

2005-11-01 20:16  staikos

	* : - fix enable-final build a bit - add missing dependencies -
	  remove some kdebugs

2005-11-01 20:00  staikos

	* : non-existent

2005-11-01 18:41  tskisner

	* : More realistic plan for healpix support. My goal is to get
	  save/load to kst file working and maybe a testcase before Nov. 4.
	  I am assuming that a developers release is essentially a feature
	  freeze followed by testing and critical bug fixing?

2005-11-01 17:34  staikos

	* : done data object porting

2005-11-01 17:33  staikos

	* : Finish porting all of the data dialogs.

2005-11-01 17:31  truch

	* : Update the spec file.

2005-11-01 16:57  staikos

	* : port the vector dialog to the new system, fix the matrix dialog

2005-11-01 16:07  staikos

	* : Port the curve dialog to the new dialog system (I think there
	  are bugs in this one with respect to tristate)

2005-11-01 15:40  staikos

	* : - port event monitor dialog to the new system - add missing i18n
	  - simplify some of our messageboxes a bit - add some missing
	  locking

2005-11-01 07:48  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-11-01 05:29  staikos

	* : add missing locking

2005-11-01 05:25  staikos

	* : - port the matrix dialog to the new dialog system (relatively
	  untested) - use the dialog launcher in kst2dplot

2005-11-01 04:45  staikos

	* : Port the image dialog to the new system and add missing locking

2005-11-01 03:20  staikos

	* : port the CSD dialog - relatively untested

2005-11-01 02:57  staikos

	* : Convert the histogram dialog to the new dialog system

2005-11-01 02:16  staikos

	* : port the PSD dialog to the new system

2005-11-01 01:34  staikos

	* : copy over missing tabstops and connections and remove the old
	  dialog

2005-11-01 00:31  staikos

	* : 1000 does seem best, though dropping it very low seems to help
	  near the edges

2005-11-01 00:22  staikos

	* : A patch to implement a short-cut interpolation in the hot spots
	  in curve plotting. It removes a function call (inlines it) and two
	  branches, one of which has a disjunction, neither of which are
	  likely. However it's slightly incomplete because it can cause
	  invalid memory accesses if the vectors have size == 1 and it tries
	  to plot them. The easy solution is to plot nothing if one of the
	  vectors has size == 1, but I suspect that's undesired.

2005-10-31 23:09  thiago

	* : SVN_SILENT Not scripts

2005-10-31 21:46  staikos

	* : one more missed update

2005-10-31 21:40  staikos

	* : update when showing

2005-10-31 19:48  staikos

	* : finally get all of the dependencies listed. I hate automake.

2005-10-31 17:45  staikos

	* : this seems to fix the automake build

2005-10-31 16:22  staikos

	* : this file doesn't exist

2005-10-31 15:43  staikos

	* : 3.1

2005-10-31 15:32  staikos

	* : possibly fix the automake build

2005-10-31 03:46  staikos

	* : fix build

2005-10-31 02:35  staikos

	* : put string selector in the right place

2005-10-31 02:29  staikos

	* : fix includes

2005-10-31 01:15  staikos

	* : Port the equation dialog over to the new dialog base as an
	  example. Feedback appreciated. I'll wait before porting the rest.
	  Notice that the dialogs don't change almost at all, but the .ui
	  file is much simpler.

2005-10-30 23:59  tskisner

	* : Add support for QU vectorfields. Also move some declarations to
	  eliminate compiler warnings

2005-10-30 23:50  tskisner

	* : readField from the healpix datasource now returns one of the 4
	  vectors of coordinates used in the vectorfield. But we cannot plot
	  vectorfields yet...

2005-10-30 23:33  staikos

	* : - get the plugin working - merge more into kstdatadialog - fix
	  naming and other minor things in the editmultiple widget

2005-10-30 23:11  staikos

	* : use a const iterator

2005-10-30 22:47  staikos

	* : remove some unused images

2005-10-30 20:24  staikos

	* : switch to using a designer plugin and convert all our .ui files.
	  We might have some unused images left in the .uis that can be
	  removed

2005-10-30 19:17  staikos

	* : add missing locking, use the dialog launcher

2005-10-30 19:00  staikos

	* : - add locking (untested, but completely missing!) - use the
	  dialog launcher - remove dependency between matrix selector and
	  dialog

2005-10-30 18:46  staikos

	* : fix indenting

2005-10-30 18:20  staikos

	* : add edit multiple widget

2005-10-30 18:10  staikos

	* : remove data dialog

2005-10-30 17:14  staikos

	* : create a designer plugin for kst widgets. They don't all work
	  yet.

2005-10-30 17:04  tskisner

	* : Change names of vectorfield components from 1/2 to theta/phi in
	  order to be more clear.

2005-10-30 15:06  staikos

	* : add const

2005-10-30 04:39  tskisner

	* : Disable all coordinates except RA/DEC for now

2005-10-30 01:01  netterfield

	* : legend names soon will not have to equal tag names.

2005-10-30 00:40  staikos

	* : bring this up to the times so that we can use it as a
	  replacement for dataobjectdialog.h. It just needs some work on
	  editMultiple and some UI work and it should be ready.

2005-10-29 23:25  staikos

	* : missing i18n

2005-10-29 23:12  staikos

	* : use the new virtuals

2005-10-29 23:11  staikos

	* : switch the data type to double for time functions and bump the
	  revision number happy recompile!

2005-10-29 18:58  staikos

	* : as far as I can tell, this isn't just likely, it's a tautology.
	  It can't reach this point if this isn't true.

2005-10-29 18:44  staikos

	* : already done

2005-10-29 15:48  staikos

	* : forgot to commit this update

2005-10-29 15:44  staikos

	* : A large number of performance fixes for updating and painting
	  images. Feedback appreciated - and timings too. If someone sends
	  me a good testcase I can also test timing.

2005-10-29 14:55  staikos

	* : remove printf

2005-10-29 06:20  netterfield

	* : CCBUG: 114826 Make offset tick label mode work again...

2005-10-29 06:09  tskisner

	* : oops, forgot to add the interface file...

2005-10-29 06:07  tskisner

	* : Huge changes to the healpix datasource. Add new config widget,
	  more units handling, save/load, and beginnings of vectorfield
	  support.

2005-10-29 04:20  tskisner

	* : Export timezone classes to KST namespace instead of KDECORE. Kst
	  now compiles for me on KDE 3.3.2. Somebody please double check
	  that this change is correct.

2005-10-29 02:35  staikos

	* : missed one cae

2005-10-29 01:08  staikos

	* : fix compile on KDE < 3.5 and some more work on timezone settings
	  - almost done

2005-10-27 19:50  staikos

	* : remove the timezone UI

2005-10-27 19:47  tskisner

	* : Add a backgroundColor member to KstCurveRenderContext. In
	  KstImage, plot pixels this color if the corresponding matrix
	  element is infinite or NAN

2005-10-27 19:13  staikos

	* : use an array instead

2005-10-27 19:02  staikos

	* : Add a timezone combobox to settings, defaulting to UTC, and make
	  kst2dplot only use that. UI has yet to be removed from
	  kstplotdialog. Note that saving the timezone is presently broken.

2005-10-27 18:28  staikos

	* : unneeded

2005-10-27 02:17  staikos

	* : more fixes to the procedure

2005-10-26 22:27  staikos

	* : - remove redundancies - I change my mind. _size > 0 is a
	  precondition and if that fails, then we crash. This is too
	  performance critical for another if().

2005-10-26 21:09  staikos

	* : now I feel more comfortable as I slightly regress speed by
	  adding a huge pile of missing locks

2005-10-26 20:30  staikos

	* : one from the obvious department: use memset

2005-10-26 20:22  staikos

	* : - experiment with dropping the number of points in the polyline
	  to try to get better X responsiveness - use gcc __builtin_expect
	  where available. it's not always useful where it's implemented but
	  at least it reminds us where the hot spots are. also please keep
	  these up to date because they can have negative impact if the code
	  changes and they aren't maintained

2005-10-26 20:05  staikos

	* : pass the curve render context by reference - might want to use a
	  pointer later if we want to return (a) value(s)

2005-10-26 19:49  staikos

	* : getIndexNearX was changed to an inline function - it was called
	  at least twice per paint, was a virtual function, and was doing
	  unnecessary lookups. it's not called anywhere externally.

2005-10-26 19:19  staikos

	* : add a cache for the more commonly called scalars to avoid dict
	  lookups in the update thread -> cpu load reduction during updates.
	  Also inlined accessors and de-virtualized length() since no-one
	  was overriding it. Make sure you make clean before rebuilding.

2005-10-26 18:26  staikos

	* : a bunch of smaller optimizations and cleanups

2005-10-26 17:35  staikos

	* : add benchmarking

2005-10-26 16:27  staikos

	* : add a directory for patches for ideas that are not ready to
	  commit yet but might be finished one day.

2005-10-26 15:08  staikos

	* : shave off a few d2i and fabs() calls

2005-10-26 14:25  staikos

	* : in the spirit of the name, ascii files are --- ascii, not
	  unicode. This gives at least 10% speedup in reading ascii files by
	  my count.

2005-10-26 06:28  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-10-26 06:14  staikos

	* : remove trailing whitespace

2005-10-26 06:11  staikos

	* : remove even more orders of map lookups

2005-10-26 05:51  staikos

	* : make plotting ~3-4 times faster than before. This was a very
	  major regression. There is more work to do here. QMap<QString,*>
	  lookups were being done multiple times inside tight loops! (and no
	  error checking was done) Also interpolations were done when they
	  didn't need to be.

2005-10-26 04:56  staikos

	* : mostly cleanup, comments about inefficiencies, and factor away
	  some extra sin, cos, and fabs that get called frequently.

2005-10-26 04:34  staikos

	* : some debug cleanup and add a couple flush() which reduce the
	  draw time a bit

2005-10-26 04:11  staikos

	* : and..... a HUGE optimization in painting. Previously we were
	  calling alignment updates for every paint. Now we only call it
	  when a content is dirty. This is a lazy fix though, and
	  internalAlignment is really still too messy/slow. Previous to the
	  commit: expose event could take as much as 2000ms. After the
	  commit: max event I could generate took 2ms. That's 1000x
	  improvement.

2005-10-26 03:58  staikos

	* : no need to do so much

2005-10-26 03:56  staikos

	* : a big simplification and refactor. gets rid of extra map lookups
	  and reduces branching and other operations in hotspots

2005-10-26 03:48  staikos

	* : methods that pass multiple return values via reference are
	  banned. They're too error-prone and lead to confusion and
	  hard-to-trace bugs.

2005-10-26 02:34  staikos

	* : a huge speedup. We were calling update on the slave vector every
	  update cycle, and we really didn't need to. As a side note,
	  KstVector::update() is just way too expensive.

2005-10-26 01:53  staikos

	* : I just discovered this missing lock in kstvector. This is a
	  serious potential for crash. It affects 1.1.1 as well, but it
	  needs testing first. Should we hold 1.1.1 or release 1.1.1 and do
	  a very quick 1.1.2 with this fix and some performance work? I'll
	  backport after testing is complete.

2005-10-26 01:38  staikos

	* : don't keep looking up in the map if we don't need to

2005-10-25 23:40  staikos

	* : make tracing work

2005-10-25 23:11  staikos

	* : this is no longer a bottleneck issue, so remove timings (and
	  noise)

2005-10-25 22:21  tskisner

	* : Plot gridlines after the basecurves but before axes. This way
	  images do not cover up the grid lines.

2005-10-25 20:54  tskisner

	* : Enable healpix autoscaling by default. Still need a config
	  widget...

2005-10-25 20:52  tskisner

	* : Matrix values that are infinite or NAN should not be considered
	  "ok"

2005-10-25 20:39  staikos

	* : updated release info

2005-10-25 16:46  tskisner

	* : whoops, forgot this...

2005-10-25 16:44  tskisner

	* : Ignore NAN values when computing matrix statistics. Initialize
	  min/max to the first finite, non-NAN value (rather than just the
	  first value). Fixes autoscaling if matrix contains NANs

2005-10-25 14:58  staikos

	* : ignore

2005-10-25 14:57  staikos

	* : add a new helper for working with back buffers

2005-10-25 14:52  staikos

	* : this is as good as we can get here. The last problem is lock
	  contention.

2005-10-25 14:06  staikos

	* : remove all references to filter sets

2005-10-25 06:28  tskisner

	* : Remove all projection and gridline stuff from the healpix
	  datasource. This will be supported (eventually) by a renderer.

2005-10-25 06:25  tskisner

	* : Add renderer proposal to developer-docs

2005-10-25 03:46  staikos

	* : A very significant speedup in data manager updates, but there's
	  still something very wrong here, so I left the benchmark code in
	  for now.

2005-10-25 03:19  netterfield

	* : Fix a ylabel location regression.

2005-10-24 13:01  staikos

	* : proper recursion

2005-10-24 05:06  staikos

	* : Add a tool for testing a new idea for painting.

2005-10-24 04:07  staikos

2005-10-23 17:11  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:108084 First draft of functionality

2005-10-23 06:16  netterfield

	* : size() for plot labels now returns the rotated dimensions.
	  PlotLabel rotation now works (could use some tweaking).

2005-10-22 22:39  netterfield

	* : More work on rotated plot labels

2005-10-22 17:34  netterfield

	* : Start to fix rotated labels... not done yet. Copy only grabs
	  numbers, not the parenthesis.

2005-10-22 15:42  arwalker

	* : cleanup

2005-10-22 05:55  staikos

	* : when advancing, only advance so that the last existing sample is
	  the last sample shown, at most.

2005-10-22 05:25  staikos

	* : paint objects top->down instead of bottom->up to make sure we
	  don't get inproper geometries or artifacts. As a side effect,
	  painting goes from O(n^2) to O(n) which is nice. BUG: 114788

2005-10-22 04:56  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-10-22 04:51  staikos

	* : set to designer 3.1. there are a couple of PNGs lurking in our
	  .ui files again

2005-10-22 04:47  staikos

	* : Some major reworkings that don't seem to cause any visible
	  regressions, and other things: 1) Remove unneeded virtuals 2)
	  KstViewObject::paint now takes a QRegion which is used in the case
	  that the paint is triggered by X11. It allows us to update only
	  the regions necessary. -> faster 3) Add a new setting that
	  disables timezone conversion and assumes UTC everywhere. This one
	  needs more testing, and some usability thought. It is also ON by
	  default. BUG: 114364

2005-10-21 23:35  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:108084 Remember dialog settings.

2005-10-21 04:58  staikos

	* : compile

2005-10-20 22:20  arwalker

2005-10-20 22:06  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:108084 Add icon for differentiate curves tool

2005-10-20 18:54  arwalker

	* : Update curve differntiation tool UI based on feedback. If there
	  are no more comments I'll implement the functionality.

2005-10-20 18:39  arwalker

	* : Make UI more consistent with general kst style.

2005-10-20 17:14  arwalker

	* : BUG:111176 Enable the Cleanup Layout menu item in all modes.

2005-10-20 12:48  netterfield

	* : reset font sizes on draw if we are using resolution enhancement.

2005-10-20 06:17  netterfield

	* : Saving several of the plot label properties now works. Applying
	  several of the properties from the plot dialog now works.
	  xTickLabels, yTickLabels, and FullLabels are now separate, because
	  they may have different properties (rotation).

2005-10-20 00:35  staikos

	* : don't crash trying to interpolate size < 2 vectors

2005-10-19 22:31  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:108084 Proposed UI for curve differentation tool. If there
	  are no comments I'll implement the functionality at some point

2005-10-19 21:55  arwalker

	* : Use new CSD icon in the data manager

2005-10-19 21:52  staikos

	* : add assertions to detect invalid memory access

2005-10-19 20:43  arwalker

2005-10-19 20:22  netterfield

	* : Remove depricated methods from kstplotlabel...

2005-10-19 20:12  netterfield

	* : Move plotlabel size updates to InternalAlignment which happens
	  first. Label alignment in printing works again in common cases...

2005-10-19 19:47  arwalker

	* : Update the CSD icon

2005-10-19 18:54  arwalker

	* : Install the CSD icon

2005-10-19 18:27  arwalker

	* : Restore tabs

2005-10-19 18:21  arwalker

	* : Add icon for the choose color tool

2005-10-19 05:44  netterfield

	* : The tick labels are now treated in the same way as the x,y,top
	  labels. Font size updating is moved to plotlabel from 2dplot There
	  are still bugs-o-plenty in anything non-standard... sigh...

2005-10-19 03:56  netterfield

	* : Some minor changes to labels... still more bugs in process...

2005-10-16 20:00  staikos

	* : some cleanup and make the vim modeline work again

2005-10-16 06:10  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-10-16 02:03  netterfield

	* : Fix WYSIWYG for X,Y,Top, tick labels. Now works for both scaling
	  windows and printing. Also adjust superscripts a little in
	  labelrenderer. It is my desire that we stop breaking 2dplot...

2005-10-12 16:42  brisset

	* : First KDE commit ever: I hope it won't break anything :-)
	  Vectors of size 1 in CDF files should be handled like scalars (I

	* : Remove the Close menu item. It doesn't make sense in MDI. BUG:
	  112494

2005-10-11 17:47  staikos

	* : - add an assertion on attempts to allocate a buffer of less than
	  1 byte - make the buffer always bigger than 0, but perhaps
	  incorrectly so. Don, I need some feedback here. What were you
	  trying to do? :)

2005-10-11 04:14  staikos

	* : some things to be optimized

2005-10-11 03:59  staikos

	* : some minor speedups

2005-10-11 02:54  staikos

	* : flush the painter after each view object is painted. I'm not
	  sure it really helps any, but it's worth a try.

2005-10-11 02:44  staikos

	* : use a busy cursor when opening a Kst file too

2005-10-11 02:41  staikos

	* : use a busy cursor to make it clear that Kst is loading ...
	  something

2005-10-11 02:37  staikos

	* : update the statusbar before we go into the heavy loading section

2005-10-11 02:29  staikos

	* : fix painting of XY guidelines. There are still cases that break.
	  Testcases will be appreciated.

2005-10-11 01:45  staikos

2005-10-10 07:51  binner

	* : compile with Qt 3.3.5

2005-10-09 15:39  tskisner

2005-10-09 15:27  mlaurent

	* : Fix ui files

2005-10-08 17:20  staikos

	* : might help a bit in keeping the X server from falling too far
	  behind

2005-10-07 21:49  staikos

	* : add assignment operator for plot labels and implement copy to
	  keep that working for now.

2005-10-07 21:33  staikos

	* : save X, Y, top labels in plots

2005-10-07 21:23  staikos

	* : load X, Y, Top labels from kst files

2005-10-07 20:47  staikos

	* : x,y,top labels basically draw in the right place now

2005-10-07 20:30  staikos

	* : A good start at getting X, Y and Top labels working again

2005-10-07 18:19  staikos

	* : another 11% or better increase in startup time by delaying font
	  checks

2005-10-07 18:12  staikos

	* : 5.75% improvement in startup time by delaying parsing the plugin
	  XML

2005-10-07 17:33  staikos

	* : delay loading of extensions - gives a big boost in the apparent
	  startup time when the JS extension is active, but it's not really
	  a boost since it just churns later.

2005-10-07 16:51  staikos

	* : major reduction in KJSEmbed dependencies. I may remove kjsembed
	  altogether and have 1.2 KstScript be a non-gui script. KJSEmbed is
	  a huge footprint now and startup time is suffering.

2005-10-06 20:38  arwalker

	* : fix compile error

2005-10-06 20:36  arwalker

	* : fix compiler warnings and indentation

2005-10-06 16:53  staikos

	* : add more benchmarking to illustrate problem with
	  QPainter::drawText() being randomly slow

2005-10-06 16:16  staikos

	* : avoid QFont construction and metrics calls if we don't need them

2005-10-06 15:51  staikos

	* : cache the font metrics and remove an if() from common called
	  methods

2005-10-06 15:19  staikos

	* : exorcise kstlabel permanently

2005-10-06 15:18  staikos

	* : Break plot labels even more, but again, only temporarily. This
	  removes all cases of KstLabel in the tree!! It also moves
	  QFontMetrics calls out of the inner loops and the drawing/painting
	  areas in hopes of avoiding the freezes we sometimes experience.
	  I'm still investigating that.

2005-10-06 15:07  staikos

	* : fix negative indenting

2005-10-06 14:53  staikos

	* : make rana build again

2005-10-06 01:44  staikos

	* : wipe out more KstLabel

2005-10-06 01:30  staikos

	* : dead code

2005-10-06 01:28  staikos

	* : It's clear that the plot label code isn't going to be fixed
	  until the brokenness is brutally obvious, so here it goes. This
	  replaces tick labels with the new label rendering code. The font
	  sizing is probably quite broken, and the plot dialog interface for
	  labels is probably nonfunctional. However, this should be more
	  clean in the long run, is more efficient now I think, and can
	  definitely be made much more efficient yet. Next stop: x, y, top
	  labels.

2005-10-05 19:08  staikos

2005-10-04 22:32  tskisner

2005-10-03 20:11  tskisner

2005-09-26 13:28  staikos

	* : fix compile - missed an export changeover

2005-09-25 22:15  staikos

	* : A monster commit with the bulk of my changes from Paris that
	  weren't already committed. Includes: 1) A replacement for
	  kdDebug() and friends that is threadsafe. It's ugly, but it works.
	  A global mutex is in place now. This makes kdDebug slow, but it
	  doesn't really matter since it gets compiled out in production.
	  The new replacement is in "ksdebug.h". Do NOT use kdDebug anymore.
	  There are some commented-out calls still lurking. 2) Re-focus on
	  the equation input after filling an operator, scalar, or vector.
	  3) Add a new extension called "pulse" which generates a signal at
	  a specified frequency in a vector. There are TODOs noted in the
	  pulse.cpp file, but it basically works and actually virtually
	  anything can be done with it by manipulating the data stream with
	  an equation. This virtually obsoletes the need of external scripts
	  to generate realtime test data. However the "save" function is not
	  implemented yet. 4) Implement most of the feature request for a
	  guideline in X or Y zoom modes. However it's very buggy, as you
	  will see. I hope to fix it this week. 5) Enforce the file format
	  for Kst a bit more. Check version numbers of kst files and make
	  sure they contain a kstdoc node. Write out a version number. 6)
	  Forward port planck.cpp changes from the branch. 7) Probably
	  something else I can't remember.

	  them.

2005-09-22 13:00  staikos

	* : - add an assert to the planck plugin for safety check - add lots
	  of asserts to kstrvector, and don't try to resize the vector to 0
	  and then read -1 from the data source.

2005-09-22 11:39  staikos

	* : if vectors can be size=1, let's allow resize to go there.

2005-09-21 14:18  staikos

	* : memory leak fix from the branch

2005-09-21 12:04  staikos

	* : fix memory leak

2005-09-21 11:37  netterfield

	* : Introduce KstPaintType P_UPDATE, which means that at least one
	  curve has been updated. If any curves are updated, then redraw all
	  kstviewlabels.

2005-09-20 14:44  staikos

	* : fix piolib skip somewhat. It no longer reads off-by-one and
	  crashes.

2005-09-20 10:04  staikos

	* : synchronize with the branch. also add a fix for locking in the
	  dialog.

2005-09-19 19:39  staikos

	* : - remove some apparently dead code - increase data mode
	  precision. Rounding really isn't right. I tried to make a fast
	  heuristic for determining the precision automatically but I think
	  it's too much work and not worth the effort. BUG: 111044

2005-09-19 09:35  netterfield

	* : remove another render on resize in viewlabels by using the
	  back-buffer to generate the transparency mask.

2005-09-19 01:12  staikos

	* : Make labels empty by default. No-one wants a label that says
	  "Text". Also disable auto-defaulting of properties. it's confusing
	  and annoying in my opinion, but if the feature is demanded, we can
	  come up with a better solution

2005-09-19 01:00  staikos

	* : remove extra draws and temporary debug messages that aren't
	  needed. This fixes rotation and other properties of labels, which
	  weren't updating properly.

2005-09-18 05:13  netterfield

	* : More improvements to view labels. resize resize bug fixed fewer
	  renders called

2005-09-16 17:14  staikos

	* : This lock isn't recursive, so acquire it only once BUG: 112751

2005-09-16 01:48  staikos

	* : Add a context menu for tabs, and make them movable via drag and
	  drop too. I think this needs some testing in realtime mode. I'm
	  afraid it will be crashy. Close doesn't work right, but a bug is
	  already filed for that.

2005-09-15 20:47  staikos

	* : I'm not sure why this was done, but it seems to be wrong. There
	  are many non- editable vectors and matrices that will need to be
	  purged too. Was it intended to purge -all- editable vectors and
	  matrices regardless of reference count? If so, that's a different
	  case altogether, but I'm not sure if that's wise since it could
	  leave to very confusing object hierarchies. For now, revert.

2005-09-15 14:10  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-09-15 14:05  staikos

	* : add a notifier LED in the statusbar (yay, a real-world use for
	  KLed!) that illuminates when new data arrives. could use a bit of
	  cosmetic and performance work, which is documented

2005-09-15 13:11  netterfield

	* : Printing transparent labels works better now.

2005-09-15 05:19  staikos

	* : i18n() text. this code is somewhat wrong in that it compares
	  i18ned text now.

2005-09-15 04:57  staikos

	* : add a note so we know what to fix when this breaks again

2005-09-15 04:54  staikos

	* : cleanup the formatting a bit, and fix linestep on
	  KDoubleSpinBox. That's one strange class. It basically doesn't
	  work as documented.

2005-09-15 04:00  staikos

	* : SVN_SILENT remove NULL

2005-09-15 03:58  staikos

	* : - push variables back into the right scope - use preincrements -
	  lock the lists before we copy them. We might have to do this
	  elsewhere too. I don't think we need a deepcopy here.

2005-09-14 19:59  staikos

	* : fix updates of objects depending on vectors from plugins.
	  Perhaps quite inefficient but at least it updates now. NumNew is
	  set to length() when a plugin says it updated the output vectors.
	  Also fixes a bug in NumNew where it became negative when
	  vectorRealloced() was triggered.

2005-09-14 19:57  staikos

	* : - cleanup of formatting to make it much more legible - convert a
	  for-loop into a memset which will be much more efficient on
	  optimized builds

2005-09-14 17:04  staikos

	* : Add a statusbar notifier of errors. Clicking on it shows the
	  debug log. A new icon set of two or more icons for the animation
	  would be appreciated. Also kstlinestyle should only exist once,
	  not one time for each user, so don't put static arrays in .h
	  files.

2005-09-14 14:45  staikos

	* : Errors should be filed as errors

2005-09-14 07:33  netterfield

	* : A number of 'fixes' to viewlabels: -If a plot is dirty, declare
	  its children dirty. -this is a hack so that fit labels will get
	  updated until labels which refer to dirty scalars can be dirtied
	  automatically. -Make 'transparent' label maintain anti-aliasing.
	  This looks better in the common case, but the transparency is no
	  longer perfect. Another solution could be considered. -Make
	  autoresized labels scale with the screen size. This follows the
	  same rules as the old kstlabes did: 0 means the default size for a
	  plot of a certain size, and will scale with the plot (Currently it
	  scales with the window, but I will fix this shortly). For
	  non-autoresized labels, use a fixed size. All sizes are relative
	  to the global settings font size.

2005-09-13 19:12  staikos

	* : add Ted and Matt to the credits. if you think your spam filters
	  are good enough, feel free to add your email address. (or any
	  other info)

2005-09-13 18:58  staikos

	* : - remove x = new Foo; if (x) - fix formatting - fix flicker when
	  escape is hit in layout mode -> there is also a bug here which was
	  not tracked yet - use a const iterator where possible

2005-09-13 18:29  staikos

	* : remove printf()

2005-09-13 18:28  staikos

	* : - delispify a bit - use C++ type conversions - factor out
	  abs/fabs calls (ex: abs(x)/abs(y) == abs(x/y)) - note about
	  kst_cast<> being expensive and finding a better solution for
	  finding the right handler object

2005-09-13 18:15  staikos

2005-09-13 18:00  staikos

2005-09-13 11:01  netterfield

	* : Fix merge error...

2005-09-13 07:34  netterfield

	* : Make it so the fit label generator can find all the parameters,
	  even thought the newly created fit plugin has never been updated.
	  There are a few debugging printfs in here for tracking down labels
	  never being updated which will deleted soon...

2005-09-13 06:59  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-09-12 18:47  staikos

2005-09-12 18:34  staikos

	* : TRUE->true (C++ standard) and DoFoo->doFoo notation

2005-09-12 17:25  staikos

	* : memory leak fixes

2005-09-12 17:06  staikos

	* : fix warning

2005-09-12 16:20  staikos

	* : enable the JS extension compile. It's a good reason why some
	  people could be seeing weird crashes. An old extension that is
	  mismatched with the build could be binary incompatible.

2005-09-12 14:33  staikos

	* : - remove old KstViewLabel dialog - unify "edit" support for
	  objects - add missing vim modelines - fix vim modelines - detabify
	  files

2005-09-12 13:56  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-09-12 13:52  staikos

	* : missed a stray semicolon

2005-09-12 13:51  staikos

	* : fix vim modelines and use a namespace instead of a class

2005-09-12 13:47  staikos

	* : - fix memory leak due to circular reference - make the edit
	  object dialog modal and put it on the object directly. it doesn't
	  make sense to keep it globally. it may not make sense to leave it
	  as a modal dialog either, but that can easily be changed later
	  once the implications are sorted out - add refresh timer property
	  to pictures - fix the geometry of the properties dialog a bit

2005-09-12 12:33  staikos

	* : fix memory leak: circular SharedPtr references caused toplevel
	  views to never be destroyed.

2005-09-12 12:21  staikos

	* : Make sure we get config.h

2005-09-09 17:42  arwalker

	* : fix indentation

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-09-08 22:51  truch

	* : Apply Don Wiebe's getdata modifications: Adds a MULTIPLY derived
	  field for multiplying two fields. Adds the ability to LINCOM

	* : Delete old hpic datasource

2005-09-06 19:09  tskisner

	* : Update configure.in.in and the datasource Makefile.am to use the
	  healpix datasource

2005-09-06 19:08  tskisner

	* : New healpix datasource converted from hpic data source. All
	  functionality not found in chealpix is contained in the
	  datasource- so we can use either chealpix or hpic.

2005-09-05 02:27  truch

	* : Update kst.spec.in so rpms can be built. This line will have to
	  be uncommented when kstcmd is again installed (when js is turned
	  back on).

2005-09-05 02:25  truch

	* : Make make -f Makefile.cvs work again (was failing because of
	  undeclared variable in Makefile) This was causing fresh svn to
	  fail and svn2dist to fail.

2005-09-04 04:22  netterfield

	* : BUG: 111405 Change pts dialog now remembers what vectors are

2005-09-03 22:28  netterfield

	* : BUG: 111850 Selecting to update labels updates the labels (adds
	  new curve to the list) Selecting to not update labels does nothing
	  to the labels. There is now no way to add a curve but delete the
	  labels from the data manager.

2005-08-22 18:04  truch

	* : [Perhaps this isn't allowed, so let me know if I've overstepped
	  my bounds.] Conglomerate kst version numbers so they only have to
	  be changed in one place (in configure.in.in). This makes it much
	  easier (and safer) to create a kst release. Extra helpful for
	  people making rpms (or slack packages) from subversion and who
	  want to have version numbers that actually change more often than
	  the rare times kst is officially released. Don Wiebe contributed
	  the bulk of this patch.

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-08-19 22:11  rchern

	* : Restore focusRect to show which object has focus, but with 2
	  differences: - instead of rectangle, draw outlines of the
	  hotpoints in the inverted background color. Selected objects with
	  focus have green hotpoint with white outlines; selected objects
	  without focus have green hotpoints with black outlines. Unselected
	  objects with focus have transparent hotpoints with hotpoint
	  outlines only. - instead of repainting everytime focus changes,
	  just draw over the old focusRect (to clear it) and draw the new
	  focusRect, without repainting any of the view objects (reduces
	  flicker, which was one of the reasons focusRect behaviour was
	  removed) All mouse behaviour remains the same - focusRect is just
	  for visual aid only.

2005-08-15 20:38  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:110729 There are a lot of these. The approach is to fix
	  the tab order, as best as possible. Also set buddies where
	  applicable.

2005-08-15 19:40  rchern

	* : Preparation for saving of graphics viewobjects: - make saveTag
	  only save tags, not be copies of save() - remove re-implementation
	  of saveTag in all viewobjects - in KstViewObject::save() and
	  KstTopLevelView::save(), save all children normally except for
	  plots - saveTag only for children that are plots

2005-08-15 18:49  arwalker

	* : BUG:110733 Properly purge by making a loop until no further
	  objects are removed.

2005-08-15 18:00  arwalker

2005-08-13 12:58  mlaurent

	* : Fix ui files

2005-08-12 23:51  rchern

	* : When in any of the graphics mode, hold down Ctrl to temporarily
	  enter Layout mode. Release Ctrl to revert back to the previous
	  graphics mode. Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Shift, etc still work in the temporary
	  layout mode by keeping Ctrl held and hitting the appropriate key
	  (A, Shift, etc...).

2005-08-12 22:57  rchern

	* : hold down shift to preserve slope when moving line hotpoints

2005-08-12 22:42  rchern

	* : normalize properly when releasing button

2005-08-12 22:39  rchern

	* : resize with shift bug

2005-08-12 22:16  rchern

	* : hold down shift to maintain aspect ratio when resizing

2005-08-11 20:04  rchern

	* : - hit the delete key to delete all selected objects - hold down
	  shift while drawing to either: - preserve 1:1 ratio (for
	  rectangular objects and ellipses) - draw lines and arrows at 0,
	  45, 90 degrees - factor out some of the mouse handling code into
	  kstgfxmousehandlerutils

2005-08-11 00:44  rchern

	* : Transparency for ellipses, rectangles, and textboxes.

2005-08-10 23:14  rchern

	* : - remove dialogData function - add widgetHints function that
	  returns a map of hints for a give property name - allows bounds to
	  be set on widgets such as minValue, maxValue for QSpinBox - allows
	  additional properties to be set on widgets such as text for check
	  box - i18n dialog labels

2005-08-10 19:53  arwalker

	* : Provide more meaningful title to properties dialog

2005-08-10 19:12  rchern

	* : 2dplots should show the plot dialog when double-clicked in
	  layout mode

2005-08-10 18:52  arwalker

	* : Clean up toggleMouseMode

2005-08-10 18:46  rchern

	* : get rid of the dashed line when move/resize is cancelled

2005-08-10 18:21  rchern

	* : some cleanup

2005-08-10 18:14  rchern

	* : - more flicker reduction: only draw simple solid shadows when
	  drawing an object, and draw the real object when mouse button
	  released - cancel support for all drawing by hitting esc - I think
	  a 1 pixel wide blue border is enough for grouped objects (instead
	  of 3 pixels)?

2005-08-10 17:56  arwalker

	* : Add picture icon

2005-08-10 17:21  arwalker

	* : Make graphic menus consistent

2005-08-10 15:30  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-08-10 00:53  rchern

	* : - view objects draw their own shadow outlines - more consistent
	  style outlines for rectangular objects

2005-08-09 23:25  rchern

	* : - no flicker when moving mouse - no repaint during resizes - use
	  a minimalistic dotted outline (dotted line for lines, dotted
	  ellipse for ellipses, and dotted rectangle for rectangles)

2005-08-09 22:17  rchern

	* : redundant code

2005-08-09 21:53  rchern

	* : - crosshair cursor for line endpoints - make hotpoint areas
	  actually match the displayed hotpoint

2005-08-09 19:52  rchern

	* : Fix grouped object painting

2005-08-09 19:04  rchern

	* : - green hotpoints for everything, including plots - click to
	  select, no more focus rect - dragging still moves an object,
	  (dragging it selects it as well) - click an object to show its
	  hotpoints - double-click an object to edit it

2005-08-09 00:54  rchern

	* : - Click to select, and double click to edit an object.

2005-08-08 21:28  staikos

	* : update changelog

2005-08-08 21:10  rchern

	* : Centred resize mode - allows ellipses to be resized (hotpoints
	  for ellipses to come)

2005-08-08 19:45  staikos

	* : Add support for controlling the precision of data values
	  displayed in labels. Does not affect 2dplot labels yet since they
	  don't use the new label renderer. FEATURE: 105915

2005-08-08 18:58  staikos

	* : a note about an inefficiency here

2005-08-08 18:57  staikos

	* : support for indexed vectors

2005-08-08 18:56  staikos

	* : testcases for equations with embedded equations, and equations
	  that use indexed vectors

2005-08-08 05:37  staikos

	* : parse out more complicated embedded data references such as
	  [vector[index]] [=equation] The second case is fully implemented
	  but not fully tested. The first case is not yet activated. Also
	  fix a locking bug in the interpreter.

2005-08-08 03:44  staikos

	* : ignores

2005-08-05 19:37  rchern

	* : - make editviewobjectdialog more generic - doubles for arrowhead
	  scaling - more properties for text labels - move
	  borderedviewobject properties into itself

2005-08-04 21:58  rchern

	* : Some more useful defaults before first sticky defaults take
	  effect

2005-08-04 21:38  rchern

	* : - sticky defaults - more properties for lines/arrows -
	  workaround for Qt::PenStyle enums used in QT properties

2005-08-04 15:53  staikos

	* : add const

2005-08-04 05:21  staikos

	* : no need for virtual in these ones, right? We need to audit and
	  try to reduce our vtables in general at some point.

2005-08-03 21:31  rchern

	* : Mouse handlers for the different mouse modes to avoid cluttering
	  KstTopLevelView. These will also store sticky settings such as
	  object defaults for the different modes

2005-08-03 20:03  tskisner

	* : fix compile errors on 64bit platforms where pointer size !=
	  sizeof(uint). Also fix a typecast in jseventmapper.cpp - is this
	  the intended behaviour?

2005-08-03 19:13  rchern

	* : - complete lines so they draw in all 4 quadrants - fix arrowhead
	  direction - preliminary hotpoints for lines

2005-08-02 19:22  rchern

	* : - curves draw legend symbols themselves - images have legend
	  symbols too: - gradient of the color palette if colormap, - box in
	  contour color if contourmap

2005-08-02 02:57  staikos

	* : - fix compile - I like the idea of factoring out this math
	  stuff, but let's keep it all in one file.

2005-07-30 23:21  mueller

2005-07-29 23:57  rchern

	* : No such thing

2005-07-29 23:52  rchern

	* : Image reworking: - Many KstBaseCurve properties moved to
	  KstVCurve - KstImage turned into KstBaseCurve - Much code
	  referring to KstImage removed from 2dplot, data manager, dialogs,
	  updatethread etc.. - functions provided by KstBaseCurve removed
	  from KstImage - KstBaseCurve gets paint() function, curve/image
	  rendering code removed from 2dplot, and KstCurveRenderContext
	  struct created - the following virtual functions added to
	  KstBaseCurve: virtual void paint(KstCurveRenderContext context) =
	  0; virtual KstDataObjectPtr providerDataObject() const = 0;
	  virtual double distanceToPoint(double xpos, double dx, double
	  ypos) const = 0; virtual void yRange(double xFrom, double xTo,

2005-07-28 18:38  rchern

	* : - no references to "Z" in public matrix functions - remove
	  resize(int) funciton and replace with resize(int x, int y)
	  function - remove rawData function and replace with
	  setValue(double x, double y, double z) and setValueRaw(int x, int
	  y, double z) - change value() and valueRaw() to return the values
	  and accept a pointer to a bool

	* : BUG:109467 Allow user to specify a base font size for the plots.
	  The default is 12, which will look the same as previous builds if

	* : 

2005-07-14 00:46  rchern

	* : Still allow configuring of datasource even when no matrices are
	  available (For the test MATRIX_SHORT.dat file, data needs to be
	  read starting at row 1 and headers read from row 0 for the matrix
	  to be recognized).

2005-07-13 23:53  rchern

	* : Changes to AsciiSource test implementation for matrix functions

2005-07-13 23:39  rchern

	* : - KstRMatrix implementation, including skipping frames and
	  boxcar filtering - KstDataSource uses struct for parameters
	  returned - changes to test implementation of readMatrix for
	  AsciiSource - users can no longer specify xmin, ymin, and step
	  sizes for matrices - I think this should be (and is) provided by
	  the datasource - fix constructors/destructors so they work
	  properly - fix loading/saving of matrices - minor changes to
	  matrix dialog

2005-07-13 21:02  staikos

	* : setEnabled() needs to be dependent on both I think.

2005-07-12 01:15  rchern

	  fixes for matrix dialog

2005-07-08 22:51  rchern

	* : Preliminary skeleton for KstMatrix, KstAMatrix, KstRMatrix,
	  KstSMatrix - this breaks most matrix/image functionality for now -
	  KstSMatrix mostly works now; it is a gradient along x or y axis -
	  KstRMatrices can be created but only have stubs for reading from
	  datasource - KstImage reworked to work with new matrices -
	  saving/loading of matrices mostly works - revised matrix new/edit
	  dialog - _inputMatrices, _outputMatrices added to KstDataObject -
	  part of locking now - KST::matrixList added - editing of matrices

	* : Use QDict for vector stat scalars instead of QMap

2005-06-29 12:55  netterfield

	* : Devel Doc for the Plot/View Object UI.

2005-06-29 01:52  staikos

	* : Use a typedef for the QMap. I was trying to improve constness
	  which makes sense in terms of the API, but has proven to be
	  difficult to get right due to KstSharedPtr and QMap behavior.
	  Hopefully we can fix this later, especially before any of this
	  becomes public API. Oh the name is aweful. if you have a better
	  one, feel free to change it.

2005-06-29 01:07  staikos

2005-06-28 00:57  rchern

	* : Disable "duplicate dependencies" checkbox when "duplicate
	  vectors" radiobutton is not selected

2005-06-27 22:47  rchern

	* : Basic support for duplicating vectors and dependencies when
	  changing files - no support for matrices and images yet, but will
	  be supported once matrices are reworked and data objects have
	  _inputMatrices - still need to implement more support for
	  equations and events, as they have more dependencies than just
	  _inputVectors, _inputScalars, and _inputStrings CCMAIL:
	  91692@bugs.kde.org

2005-06-27 22:25  rchern

	* : Function has not been commited yet

2005-06-27 22:22  rchern

	* : Use _inputVectors for input vectors of vcurve instead of holding
	  private pointers to them - remove reimplementation of loadInputs()
	  and uses() - allows dependency checking to be more general -
	  kstcurvedialog cannot seem to unlock within the same thread after
	  locking when editing a curve

2005-06-24 21:35  staikos

	* : more details on what needs to be done for matrix/image
	  reworking.

2005-06-24 21:20  staikos

	* : missed one plugin

2005-06-24 21:19  staikos

	* : add a key to plugins that must be recent in order for the plugin
	  to be loaded. It's presently set to 1, but dropping it to 0 will
	  load old plugins again. The benefit is that we can break binary
	  compatibility inside kstdatasource and not worry about broken
	  plugins everywhere. This will likely be the only choice we have in
	  order to implement matrices and other types from datasources.
	  Requires plugin developers to add a 1-line macro call to their
	  source. All Kst SVN plugins were updated.

2005-06-24 19:22  staikos

	* : handle INF

2005-06-24 19:16  staikos

	* : this is valid now

2005-06-24 19:12  staikos

	* : note: custom column delimiters is broken by using isspace()
	  unconditionally here.

2005-06-24 19:06  staikos

	* : forgot about -. Any other cases we should support for number
	  starters? The only others I can think of are "+eE." but I think
	  they can also be considered malformed.

2005-06-24 19:03  staikos

	* : - preincrement - don't atof() if we know it's wrong

2005-06-24 18:58  staikos

	* : - save some function calls, especially atof("NaN") repeatedly. -
	  push variable into the right scope

2005-06-24 18:19  staikos

	* : whitespace changes from my label work

2005-06-24 18:04  staikos

	* : cleanup, and dump size_boost for now. It's completely
	  inconsistent in Kst and doesn't make a whole lot of sense inside
	  2dplot. Needs to be implemented differently.

2005-06-24 18:03  staikos

	* : more plot label changes for 2dplot

2005-06-24 00:40  staikos

	* : - restore designer style formatting on .ui.h file - #includes
	  don't go in .ui.h, they go in the .ui file so they can be
	  manipulated from designer

2005-06-24 00:39  staikos

	* : update release plan

2005-06-23 22:31  arwalker

	* : CCBUG:104935 Concept of allowing user to search for scalars,
	  vectors, fields, etc. Lack of feedback will be taken to indicate
	  support. Currently only implemented for the scalar selector. Click
	  on the ellipsis for a dialog that allows you to search for the
	  desired scalar.

	* : some notes

2005-06-23 17:17  arwalker

2005-06-22 19:31  staikos

	* : no it isn't

2005-06-22 19:31  staikos

	* : Remove spaces

2005-06-21 22:38  rchern

	* : Allow use of existing vector in data wizard - radiobuttons allow
	  selection of "Create from field" or "Use existing" for the x
	  vector - New/Edit buttons in the vectorselector are hidden CCMAIL:
	  107580-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-06-21 21:01  arwalker

	* : CCMAIL:106008@bugs.kde.org ascii datasource now runs faster than
	  the original version, by about 40 percent. The only difference
	  between the two is that a line such as 'X Y Z' would previously
	  have been skipped, but is now treated (correctly I believe) as '0
	  0 0'

2005-06-20 23:16  rchern

	* : Add local y maximum zoom function to context menu - shortcut key
	  Shift+L CCMAIL: 89892-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-06-20 21:07  tskisner

	* : begin process of projecting map as a flat packed matrix.
	  Projection parameters are fixed until we have a config widget.
	  This projection code should eventually go into a

	* : Somewhat closer to keeping the curve inside the bounding box on
	  resize and move

2005-06-20 00:26  staikos

	* : disable transparency for 2dplot. It's way too messy to implement
	  efficiently in this class at this point.

2005-06-19 04:13  scripty

	* : SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-06-18 21:48  staikos

	* : - a header to add variables which can be tuned to make Kst more
	  accessible - make clicks fall through transparent areas in
	  transparent widgets in layout mode which is what it looks like it
	  should behave as - make the resize border 1 pixel larger

2005-06-18 14:19  staikos

	* : Of course I documented the reason why it was broken. :-)

2005-06-18 04:10  scripty

2005-06-17 23:18  staikos

	* : some cleanup, and a [broken] implementation of auto resize

2005-06-17 22:30  arwalker

	* : CCMAIL:90932@bugs.kde.org Fixes the problem but is likely slower
	  than before. Will not mark as fixed for a few days to give people
	  a chance to review the changes.

2005-06-17 22:24  arwalker

	* : CCMAIL:90932@bugs.kde.org Correctly handle missing values when x
	  values are not monotonically increasing.

2005-06-17 18:37  arwalker

2005-06-17 18:21  staikos

	* : Add transparency support to labels, and fix some dialog bugs.

2005-06-17 16:14  staikos

	* : Get rotation working in all cases and add adjustSizeForText() to

	  readField returns a full-sphere map vector

2005-06-17 00:54  tskisner

	* : Read names/units from file and use as field names. Use generic
	  default if not specified.

2005-06-17 00:52  tskisner

	* : Fix a couple things in previous patch and detect supported
	  files. Return value of 100 (at least until LFIIO returns something
	  less than 99).

2005-06-17 00:48  tskisner

	* : Begin integrating hpic datasource as previously discussed. It
	  will only be compiled if the hpic library is installed

2005-06-16 23:46  staikos

	* : Rotation 0->90 works including size adjustments.

2005-06-16 19:29  staikos

	* : Wipe out lots of code duplication and make labels completely
	  render now. The renderer is even almost abstracted into a single
	  static function. Once rotation is fixed and transparency is
	  supported, it will be able to completely replace the rendering and
	  parsing in KstLabel too.

2005-06-16 19:28  rchern

	* : Don't cut off entries in plugin dialog. Currently plugins with
	  scalar selectors widen the dialog a lot because of the long scalar
	  names. CCMAIL: 105220@bugs.kde.org

2005-06-16 18:33  staikos

	* : documentation fixes, and make frameCount work

2005-06-01 11:20  staikos

	* : ported scalar and string to use inheritence. this is tedious.

	* : make it run on non-debug builds

2005-06-01 09:28  staikos

	* : Heavy reworking of classes that inherit - more to come. Also
	  added a base class for KstObject which is abstract and not

2005-05-31 22:58  arwalker

	* : Add icons for graphics objects. CCMAIL: 91675@bugs.kde.org

2005-05-31 19:38  rchern

2005-05-31 14:48  staikos

	* : hm we can still build with our own kjsembed I guess... for now.

2005-05-31 14:47  staikos

	* : not worth the trouble

2005-05-31 14:36  staikos

	* : missing paints

2005-05-31 02:57  rchern

	* : Transformed top and right axes via expressions: - expression in
	  terms of X for top axis - expression in terms of Y for right axis
	  - major tick marks are the same for opposing axes as this makes
	  sense with grid lines Base and offset mode for top and right axis
	  still to be done Tick label positions still need to be fine tuned
	  for when tick marks are outside plot

2005-05-30 07:14  staikos

	* : add missing files

2005-05-29 16:08  staikos

2005-05-28 11:54  staikos

	* : date is also special

2005-05-28 11:30  staikos

	  some bugs to fix, and started bindings for view objects in
	  general. Fixed some minor bugs found along the way.

2005-05-28 00:02  rchern

	* : Don't align top and bottom axes with other plots when they are
	  suppressed

2005-05-27 23:37  rchern

	* : Top and bottom axes suppression - lines still remain to separate
	  the plots - is this desired?

2005-05-27 22:55  arwalker

	* : Initialize axis tick settings for newly created plots.

2005-05-27 22:49  arwalker

	* : Corretly indent the vector properties in kst files

2005-05-26 19:32  staikos

	* : Documented most of the remaining classes. Constructors are
	  missing though. Also fixed an array offset bug in DataVector

2005-05-26 17:27  staikos

	* : not needed right now

2005-05-26 16:56  rchern

	* : Updated proposed plot dialog UI - top, bottom, left, and right
	  options have been removed (plots will always have bottom and left
	  axes unless they are suppressed, with optional transformed top and
	  right axes) - option to suppress top or bottom border and labels -

	* : Draft proposal UI for bug 96238. - the x and y axis settings are
	  on different tabs - an additional "transform opposite axis"
	  setting can be used to specify an expression for transforming the
	  axis opposite to the main one - option to have tick marks inside
	  plot, outside plot, or both

2005-05-26 00:29  staikos

	* : Document Plot

2005-05-26 00:20  staikos

2005-05-25 01:43  rchern

	* : Allow arithmetic expressions with scalars for plot ranges, and

	* : Make cleanup layout use a default approximately square grid, and
	  allow custom columns as well CCMAIL: 104636-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-05-24 15:51  staikos

	* : Added an index and linked it into class pages. I'm not happy
	  with it though - it doesn't sort, and the entries go left->right
	  instead of top-> bottom.

2005-05-24 05:26  staikos

	* : Added recursive rule to allow closing brackets on optional
	  arguments

2005-05-23 22:28  staikos

	* : add exception support

2005-05-23 21:15  staikos

	  bind_vector

2005-05-23 20:55  staikos

	* : - lots of refactoring and misc fixes for the stylesheet - added
	  constructors - don't allow construction of curves with no vectors

2005-05-23 20:01  staikos

	* : More work on the stylesheet, and implement the first xml file.
	  Hopefully even the headers for the bindings can be generated this
	  way soon.

	* : Stylesheet for generating HTML docs for the bindings

2005-05-22 19:07  staikos

	* : Well, this mostly fixes adding new plots when in maximized mode
	  (and renames zoom->maximized as we did in public interfaces).
	  Unfortunately the maximized plot has an invalid top border and I
	  haven't been able to figure out why yet. Debug output is left
	  there to demonstrate the problem. CCBUG: 106086

2005-05-22 15:20  staikos

	* : A plan for 1.1.1 to fix bugs not fixed in 1.1.0 or discovered
	  after

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-05-21 00:55  arwalker

	  is there at least.

2005-05-21 00:23  arwalker

	* : Remove special casing of solid line

2005-05-21 00:13  staikos

2005-05-20 23:53  staikos

	  remove some of the verbose error messages in order to fix the

2005-04-26 19:24  staikos

	* : prepare for beta2

2005-04-26 19:22  staikos

	* : disable time support in the ascii source for 1.1.0

2005-04-26 17:29  staikos

	* : add a static mechanism to determine if a source supports time.
	  Inefficient, but we have to wait for Kst2 for something better.
	  Fixes the vector dialog time support

2005-04-26 16:10  staikos

	* : mark new methods

2005-04-26 15:42  staikos

	* : revert const changes - this is a public interface. We don't gain
	  much from it so it's not worth duplicating the method.

2005-04-26 15:29  staikos

	* : mark new members

2005-04-26 03:56  staikos

	* : make time work the first time through

2005-04-26 02:43  staikos

	  the planck plugin. However it looks like time support needs more
	  work inside Kst core still.

2005-04-24 18:08  staikos

	* : add a good chunk of the code to create new data objects from the
	  script side, where a piece of JS code is the logic of the object
	  (basically slower plugins). It has to remain disabled right now
	  because KJS doesn't provide a mechanism to give us a separate
	  interpreter (for the thread) and make sure it doesn't race with
	  the main one.

2005-04-23 21:53  staikos

	* : Add a bit of a hack to fix fit labels, at least for the release.
	  I'm not sure it's a good idea to expose this as a public method.

	* : remove $(all_libraries)

2005-04-22 19:50  staikos

	* : remove $(all_libraries) because we don't use anything in there
	  and it makes GSL not link properly for me on SuSE 9.2

2005-04-22 18:05  staikos

	* : No newline at end of file

2005-04-18 17:36  staikos

	* : revise again. CVS is now 100% frozen for anything except
	  required bug fixes and the time input code. extensions/js is
	  excluded because it's not part of the release except as a preview.
	  If in doubt, mail the list before committing. CCMAIL:

2005-04-18 13:41  staikos

	* : ascii source now deals with files like this as valid

2005-04-17 18:34  staikos

	* : add a "connect" button to the vector dialog to avoid the KIO
	  storm too. Can't wait longer for feedback if we want a beta

2005-04-17 15:55  staikos

	* : two left to do

2005-04-17 15:54  staikos

	* : obey the editable flag, and new vectors need to be AVectors now

2005-04-17 15:46  staikos

	* : add the editable flag so we don't have to dynamic cast and
	  hardcode checks. May not be implemented everywhere for 1.1...

2005-04-17 15:28  staikos

	* : stat before attempting download, and don't rebuild the URL
	  implicitly

2005-04-17 15:28  staikos

	* : cleanup, add a warning when the Kst file is lying (and a
	  safeguard), and add an update method

2005-04-17 01:05  netterfield

	* : Add kstavectors, which are static vectors which can be modified,
	  saved, and loaded. There is currently no UI for them, but they
	  will be very useful in eg, scripting. They are saved, embedded in
	  the XML, by fixing endianness using a qdatastream compressing
	  base64 encoding. so they should be both reasonably storage
	  efficient, and portable. There are now 4 kinds of vectors:
	  RVectors: a field read from a data source, which updates with the
	  data source. SVectors: a static vectors defined as N equally
	  spaced points from x0 to x1. AVectors: a static, editable vector
	  of N arbitrary points, which can be saved and loaded. Vectors: a
	  base class vector is always a slave vector which gets its life and
	  content from a data object, like the X axis in a psd.

2005-04-16 16:17  staikos

	* : add configure check for kstcmd

2005-04-15 22:43  staikos

	* : Qt 3.1 compat

2005-04-15 20:40  staikos

	* : revert Barth's new icons for now. XPM is the required format if
	  we want KDE 3.1 compatibility. Barth, any chance you can store
	  them as XPM?

2005-04-15 20:29  staikos

	* : one more XBM wiped out. 9 PNGs to go

2005-04-15 20:16  staikos

	* : back to XPM you go

2005-04-15 20:04  staikos

	* : XBM->XPM for 3.1 compat

2005-04-15 17:39  staikos

	* : note that line numbers start at 0

2005-04-15 15:23  staikos

	* : circumvent the KIO "storm" by adding a "Connect" button for
	  remote URLs. I won't port this to the vector dialog until I
	  receive feedback. One of the nice things about this approach is
	  that autocompletion works. On the other hand, it requires extra
	  user interaction.

2005-04-15 03:56  staikos

	* : put the branchpoint at the right place, note that the beta
	  release may happen as far away as Monday since 3 major issues and
	  one minor issue are unresolved, and document who is responsible
	  for each unresolved issue

2005-04-15 03:53  staikos

	* : document our [half broken] collection of custom mimetypes.

2005-04-15 03:44  staikos

	* : best that can be done for now

2005-04-15 03:41  staikos

	* : can't redefine the mimetype

2005-04-15 03:39  staikos

	* : implement reset() in lfiio (untested)

2005-04-15 03:36  staikos

	* : implement reset for planck (tested)

2005-04-15 03:31  staikos

	* : implement reset() for netcdf (tested)

2005-04-15 03:24  staikos

	* : implement reset() for CDF (tested)

2005-04-15 03:20  staikos

	* : implement reset() (untested)

2005-04-15 03:17  staikos

	* : fix typo in previous commit to kstdatasource and make the
	  associated error message in datawizard more verbose

2005-04-15 03:16  staikos

	* : implement reset() for dirfile

2005-04-15 03:15  staikos

	* : implement reset for indirect sources

2005-04-15 02:37  staikos

	* : implement reset() - makes reload with ascii files very fast!

2005-04-15 01:57  staikos

	* : is this the right way to get the messages in the proper place?
	  CCMAIL: Hasso Tepper <hasso@kde.org>

2005-04-15 01:51  staikos

	* : possibly fix encoding problem in labels - please test CCMAIL:
	  Hasso Tepper <hasso@kde.org>

2005-04-14 23:58  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-04-14 23:44  staikos

	* : one dealt with, a new one discovered

2005-04-14 23:43  staikos

	* : data sources need to be marked as non-reusable if the
	  configuration changes since the user could: - load file v.txt -
	  use v.txt - load file v.txt again, reconfigure - use v.txt - load
	  file v.txt again - use v.txt In the second case, it needs to not
	  save the changes to the datasource object, but create a new
	  instance, mark the old one as non-reusable, and apply the settings
	  to the new instance. The third case needs to pick up the instance
	  created in the second load, not the first. This doesn't cover the
	  "reload" case. The problem is that reset() is not implemented in
	  most datasources so reloading will cause all new instances to be
	  created. This needs to be fixed ASAP.

2005-04-14 18:49  staikos

	* : very nice patch from Hasso to make the statusbar smaller

2005-04-14 18:03  hasso

	* : fixuifiles

2005-04-14 13:37  hasso

	* : Slightly better layout of Axes tab.

2005-04-14 11:20  hasso

	* : Slightly better layout. Avoid huge "Auto Threshold" button.

2005-04-14 10:55  hasso

	* : Slightly better layout. Avoid huge "Configure..." button.

2005-04-14 03:56  arwalker

	* : Make cursor offset reporting work for datamode also. CCMAIL:
	  102902@bugs.kde.org

2005-04-14 02:22  staikos

	* : make s-vectors update properly - the base class assumes that
	  nothing really changed since the derived classes typically
	  "update" BUG: 103849

2005-04-14 02:08  staikos

	* : Fix enabled status of the vector dialog. Patch also contains
	  some changes related to the KIO problem, but doesn't fix it. BUG:
	  103848

2005-04-14 01:55  staikos

	* : docs updates

2005-04-14 01:54  staikos

	* : finish fixed-field-widths

2005-04-14 01:02  staikos

	* : add a new static symbol so that data sources can load settings.
	  Make the ascii source load its settings.

2005-04-13 23:24  staikos

	* : save and load settings to the Kst file. Problem: we have no
	  mechanism to ask the source plugin to load yet. I think I have to
	  use the virtual hook for this.

2005-04-13 18:05  staikos

	* : we support KIO...

2005-04-13 17:59  staikos

	* : - fix numerous regressions related to KIO integration. one
	  remains (it creates a KIO storm) - enable/disable the OK button
	  based on whether we can create a vector or not. the same goes for
	  the Field combo. There is a bit of flicker in the Field combo
	  still

2005-04-13 17:14  staikos

	* : should be the rest of the regressions here

2005-04-13 16:55  staikos

	* : fix some cases of empty files not working - more to go, but
	  they're even older regressions than those from today.

2005-04-13 16:40  staikos

	* : one thing missed and it propagates all over the place. remove
	  unnecessary virtuals

2005-04-13 16:35  staikos

	* : implement header skip - causes some minor regressions that I'm
	  fixing now

2005-04-13 09:03  hasso

	* : Compile, please.

2005-04-13 06:14  staikos

	* : remove warnings, and don't clear the fieldlist because if the
	  field list changed then the row index is almost certainly wrong
	  anyway, and we don't really support such changing files

2005-04-13 05:43  staikos

	* : implement all of the new ascii options except: - extraction of
	  field names in fixed field mode - header skip in readField()

2005-04-13 04:52  staikos

	* : add UI and saving and loading of the last of Nicolas' patches,
	  minus the units. We don't have a generic mechanism for units and I
	  don't like the field names it produces (they're non-standard for
	  Kst). For 1.2 we can try to add a proper units mechanism to
	  datasources. The implementation of these options will happen
	  later, but it's important to get the strings in early.

2005-04-13 04:11  staikos

	* : another issue that has to be dealt with for 1.1.0

2005-04-13 03:17  staikos

	* : need configure checks

2005-04-13 02:28  staikos

	* : The object layout for plugins seems to work. However there is
	  still quite a bit of work to be done in adding properties and
	  functions.

2005-04-13 01:06  arwalker

	* : Added ability to define a cursor position within a plot by
	  hitting the 'C' button (Hit SHIFT+'C" to remove the cursor). Once
	  a cursor is set the status bar will show the offset from the
	  cursor position to the current mouse position. This functionality
	  also works in data mode. Do we want to add an item to the context
	  menu for this? CCMAIL: 98564@bugs.kde.org

2005-04-12 17:04  staikos

	* : pay attention and commit all the files :)

2005-04-12 16:49  staikos

	* : add binding for legends - only allows to enable/disable and move
	  front<->back. legends become kstshared.

2005-04-12 14:33  staikos

	* : that's not supposed to be there

2005-04-12 04:14  staikos

	* : create document class which provides access to load/save/new and
	  more -> move load and save out of Kst.load and Kst.save

2005-04-12 02:47  staikos

	* : de-inline

2005-04-12 02:46  staikos

	* : fix the undefined symbol error. I wasn't seeing it because KHTML
	  has that symbol in debug builds.

2005-04-12 02:39  staikos

	* : revertlast - has to be included everywhere

2005-04-12 02:36  staikos

	* : make sure jsbinding.h is always included

2005-04-12 02:00  staikos

	* : wow, didn't mean to commit that.

2005-04-12 01:55  staikos

	* : add bindings to the extension manager so scripts can load,
	  unload, or query existence of extensions

2005-04-11 21:18  staikos

	* : add bindings for kstcolorsequence

2005-04-11 20:53  staikos

	* : more built-ins

2005-04-11 20:52  staikos

	* : testcase was wrong here

2005-04-11 20:38  staikos

	* : false alert

2005-04-11 20:32  staikos

	* : match other arrays

2005-04-11 19:57  staikos

	* : unify null/undefined/exception behaviour, matching ECMA arrays

2005-04-11 16:19  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2005-04-11 16:18  staikos

	* : setColor works now - we will not use an explicit colour object

2005-04-11 13:54  staikos

	* : from reading Nicolas' code, this wasn't clear enough

2005-04-11 13:45  staikos

	* : escape unescaped buffer

2005-04-11 13:39  staikos

	* : factor regexp creation out of the loop

2005-04-11 13:25  staikos

	* : this should finish up the data formatting section of ascii
	  settings. There is no detection code for Fixed Width Columns
	  though. Nicolas' did not have any such code either.

2005-04-11 05:55  staikos

	* : make the config dialog work properly from the data wizard

2005-04-11 05:34  staikos

	* : update the dialog when config is changed

2005-04-11 05:29  staikos

	* : Make sure the dialog gets a pointer to the data source when
	  opening it. The data wizard probably has the same problem. This
	  dialog also needs to be updated when a save happens since the
	  field list could change.

2005-04-11 03:37  staikos

	* : config options are closer to working now - still some issues to
	  work out

2005-04-11 01:36  staikos

	* : - implement much of the code for the data formatting options -
	  optimize: reduce malloc calls

2005-04-10 23:22  staikos

	* : Add UI for Nicolas' "Data Formatting" options, and loading code.
	  Still inactive.

2005-04-10 22:48  staikos

	* : Merge the first of Nicolas' patches, untested. Adds support for
	  a wildcard expression that indicates that it is for sure an ascii
	  file. Changes: uses 100% instead of 90%. 90% seems to partially
	  defeat the purpose of the feature.

2005-04-10 21:51  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT two more done

2005-04-10 21:22  staikos

	* : KstScalar is private

2005-04-10 21:13  staikos

	* : another "issue"

2005-04-10 21:03  staikos

	* : install these headers

2005-04-10 21:02  staikos

	* : Noticed that these are actually public too. Good thing they're
	  relatively safe

2005-04-10 19:50  staikos

	* : add sub-lists for equations and psds

2005-04-10 19:37  staikos

	* : The X vector was wrong for PSDs BUG: 103580

2005-04-10 19:24  staikos

	* : implement Kst.objects and move powerSpectrums over there.
	  implement a generic binding for data objects that's almost empty.
	  We need a dynamic cast or similar now.

2005-04-10 18:38  staikos

	* : add power spectrum access - to be reworked

2005-04-08 22:10  staikos

	* : put more information in the dialog (there is no version number
	  for extensions) FEATURE: 103525

2005-04-08 19:48  staikos

	* : Try it, I dare you :-) Load a kst session (not too many plots
	  please, 2-3 is good), then File->Load JavaScript and run this
	  file. (Note: points out an inefficiency in painting)

2005-04-08 19:34  staikos

	* : add dirty support to labels and more bindings

2005-04-08 18:44  staikos

	* : bind labels partially and show how flawed labels are in the
	  process

2005-04-08 17:40  truch

	* : Add lncurses so that kstcmd will link

2005-04-08 16:02  staikos

	* : KstLabel becomes a KSharedPtr to make it safe for scripting

2005-04-08 05:17  staikos

	* : no constructor

2005-04-08 05:16  staikos

	* : send a log cleared event when the log is cleared (needed by JS)

2005-04-08 05:02  staikos

	* : finish off the debug interface and add a testcase

2005-04-08 04:47  staikos

	* : better error message

2005-04-08 04:43  staikos

	* : much nicer error message

2005-04-08 04:13  staikos

	* : match previous commit

2005-04-08 04:12  staikos

	* : visibility changes

2005-04-08 01:48  arwalker

	* : Redraw data mode marker correctly after a text label move
	  operation. Add const.

2005-04-07 22:26  staikos

	* : a test script for part of the Kst object

2005-04-07 22:25  staikos

	* : Harri the JS Mage says that Value() was wrong :)

2005-04-07 22:10  staikos

	* : Kst is of course an object

2005-04-07 21:35  staikos

	* : resetInterpreter() was nuking KJSEmbed too. D'oh. No way to do
	  it cleanly in KJSEmbed yet, but will be fixed eventually says Ian.

2005-04-07 20:26  staikos

	* : hm that constructor is deprecated

2005-04-07 20:23  staikos

	* : what an odd constructor

2005-04-07 19:56  staikos

	* : use our own kjsembed if scripting is requested and the KDE
	  install is too old

2005-04-07 19:26  truch

	* : Let the specfile know about libkst* files.

2005-04-07 19:07  staikos

	* : scripting requires --with-kst-scripting now

2005-04-07 18:37  staikos

	* : updated release plan to cover all the way through Kst v2.0 based
	  on requirements I know of and the "Long term goals" (taking
	  primarily major issues, since minor issues are an on-going effort)

2005-04-07 17:38  staikos

	* : parse the equation manually when setting it BUG: 103442

2005-04-07 17:07  staikos

	* : add testcase, but it passes without problems CCBUG: 103442

2005-04-06 05:50  staikos

	* : set providers on scalars and strings

2005-04-06 05:35  staikos

	* : set provider, zero() is redundant

2005-04-06 05:34  staikos

	* : - add missing support for loading string inputs/outputs - set
	  provider on scalars and strings

2005-04-06 05:33  staikos

	* : redundant

2005-04-06 05:32  staikos

	* : method to set the provider

2005-04-06 05:16  staikos

	* : save first, commit second

2005-04-06 04:38  staikos

	* : update slave vectors. however it was also discovered that this
	  code does calls in the wrong thread sometimes - a crash waiting to
	  happen. Needs to be fixed.

2005-04-06 04:33  staikos

	* : no need to use tr2i18n() manually

2005-04-06 04:07  staikos

	* : that's just max()

2005-04-06 04:01  staikos

	* : I don't think this is needed anymore since we force an update
	  now

2005-04-06 03:51  staikos

	* : force the updates of the slave vectors

2005-04-06 03:45  staikos

	* : setDirty() on setValue()

2005-04-06 03:44  staikos

	* : update output scalars and strings

2005-04-06 03:39  staikos

	* : setDirty() on setValue()

2005-04-06 03:24  staikos

	* : fix various bugs and optimizations in fit and filter dialogs and
	  fix updates in plugins BUG: 102876

2005-04-06 01:58  staikos

	* : create an s-vector instead of an orphan

2005-04-06 01:53  staikos

	* : won't gain much since it's not called often

2005-04-06 01:42  staikos

	* : more todos

2005-04-06 01:37  staikos

	* : outdated comments - can't happen anymore

2005-04-05 23:23  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-04-05 19:22  staikos

	* : make it clear that this is not for general use

2005-04-05 19:15  staikos

	* : put a lock on the update. not sure if it will deadlock, but it
	  will block so it's bad nonetheless. also use constiterator

2005-04-05 19:07  staikos

	* : stdin is a special case

2005-04-05 18:49  staikos

	* : I figured 0 was "right" but wasn't yet sure it was safe - seems
	  to be.

2005-04-05 18:36  staikos

	* : make translation a bit easier

2005-04-05 18:27  staikos

	* : decision is yes, scalars and strings are important

2005-04-05 18:17  staikos

	* : more efficient - assume we have a widget if we have a function

2005-04-05 18:10  staikos

	* : make it a bit easier to translate, format the date properly

2005-04-05 18:02  staikos

	* : no, doing it yourself is better (as we currently do where
	  needed)

2005-04-05 18:00  staikos

	* : two fixmes for the same problem

2005-04-05 17:56  staikos

	* : predicting the future

2005-04-05 17:52  staikos

	* : re-enable, it is due to broken fonts distributed and lack of
	  support in fontconfig

2005-04-05 17:48  staikos

	* : remove "FIXME" and use #if 0 to make enabling/disabling easier

2005-04-05 17:38  staikos

	* : datasources are paused, not rvectors

2005-04-05 17:35  staikos

	* : final optimization - reorder the comparison and factor out a
	  subtraction.

2005-04-05 17:33  staikos

	* : i < new_nf -> new_nf - i > 0 but skip > 0 so new_nf - i >= Skip
	  -> new_nf - i >= 1 -> new_nf - i > 0 so this is redundant

2005-04-05 17:27  staikos

	* : tightening the loop (more to come)

2005-04-05 16:33  staikos

	* : add a flag for "color mode", which is monochrome, greyscale, or
	  colour (default) This can be used, once implemented in
	  KstColorSequence functions, for both display and printing
	  purposes. We can have a submenu of Settings/ to choose the mode,
	  and likewise have options in the print settings panel.

2005-04-05 14:17  staikos

	* : move to the netcdf source that supports multiple samples per
	  frame

2005-04-05 03:40  staikos

2005-04-04 19:55  staikos

	* : make it clear

2005-04-04 18:28  staikos

	* : memory leak

2005-04-04 16:06  staikos

	* : ability to load and save Kst files

2005-04-04 15:33  staikos

	* : fix the icons. This widget is pretty much done now.

2005-04-04 15:10  staikos

	* : these are unneeded now

2005-04-04 14:59  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT 3.1

2005-04-04 14:08  netterfield

	* : BUG: 101214 GUI: Equations no longer make X vectors. They only
	  use vectors. SVectors can now be edited and viewed from the data
	  manager.

2005-04-04 06:36  staikos

	* : These paints were supposed to have been removed. Meanwhile I
	  think the whole view link in here needs to go

2005-04-04 06:21  staikos

	* : QString::null

2005-04-04 06:17  staikos

	* : add purge binding

2005-04-04 06:10  staikos

	* : added binding to KstDebug. writing works, reading is
	  unimplemented

2005-04-04 05:54  staikos

	* : update unused objects again until an additional layer is
	  implemented to add objects to a list of "forced" updates. It's
	  still a race, but it's smaller than now this way. The proper fix
	  has to be done in the UI and then this will be removed again.

2005-04-04 05:38  staikos

	* : a new debug widget - makes scrolling easier - might be faster
	  (keeps more duplicated in memory, but doesn't do as much raw
	  painting) - copy+paste, etc, works since it's a text widget now
	  All functionality is retained but the images may not all look
	  "right" just yet. Also the images don't scale relative to font
	  size.

2005-04-04 04:28  staikos

	* : no need to use QString::arg in here

2005-04-04 03:55  staikos

	* : needs to be threadsafe

2005-04-04 01:45  staikos

	* : to be clear...

2005-04-04 01:39  staikos

	* : kstdebug can be used from threads so emitting the signal was a
	  bad idea, especially when it triggered UI code.

2005-04-01 21:24  staikos

	* : long long is the type

2005-04-01 04:46  staikos

	* : C+P error

2005-04-01 04:17  staikos

	* : order was wrong

2005-04-01 00:16  staikos

	* : refactor the datasource extracting code and add support for
	  passing datasources as strings, and even implicitly loading them
	  if they aren't already loaded.

2005-03-31 23:47  staikos

	* : Add histogram binding. Problem remains of how to deal with
	  different types.

2005-03-31 23:07  staikos

	* : convert to using collection classes

2005-03-31 22:57  staikos

	* : needed in bindings (and probably elsewhere)

2005-03-31 22:52  staikos

	* : recreate the bindings

2005-03-31 22:27  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-03-31 22:26  staikos

	* : here too

2005-03-31 22:24  staikos

	* : TODO

2005-03-31 22:24  staikos

	* : add a const alternative, non-virtual. We're stuck with both
	  until Kst2 :(

2005-03-31 21:32  staikos

	* : added curve collection. makedata.js now loads data and plots it

2005-03-31 18:27  staikos

	* : reset interpreter support (thanks to David for the hints)

2005-03-31 17:58  staikos

	* : more notes

2005-03-31 17:57  staikos

	* : - add a collection base class (read-only right now) and create a
	  plot collection - attach the plot collection to the window class

2005-03-31 16:23  staikos

	* : fix crash of konsole part. when it emits the signal, we can't
	  delete it because it has intentions of deleting itself

2005-03-31 16:13  staikos

	* : - add bindings for windows and plots that are very incomplete
	  and unusable - add an exception to powerspectrum

2005-03-31 16:02  staikos

	* : The whole app is a lib now

2005-03-31 04:40  staikos

	* : toString for bind_point returns (x, y) now

2005-03-31 04:30  staikos

	* : - add point class - add notes about backward compat - activate
	  curve class - fix major typos in curve class - make curve class
	  use point

2005-03-31 04:21  staikos

	* : wrong library

2005-03-31 04:17  staikos

	* : this was a special case it seems

2005-03-30 23:01  staikos

	* : - Add bindings for curves, relatively complete including
	  constructor - Factor our vector extraction code, add support for
	  passing vector name by text

2005-03-30 22:41  staikos

	* : revert plugins from matrices. Too much is fundamentally wrong to
	  leave this in right now.

2005-03-30 21:45  staikos

	* : accessors needed

2005-03-30 19:27  staikos

	* : add support for matrices from plugins. I don't have any such
	  plugins yet so I haven't tested any of that code, but it doesn't
	  seem to cause any regressions in other areas.

2005-03-30 17:58  staikos

	* : helper function

2005-03-30 17:10  staikos

	* : - fix missing base-class init - add accessor for the vector

2005-03-30 16:08  staikos

	* : no they don't!

2005-03-30 02:43  staikos

	* : add vim modeline

2005-03-30 01:57  staikos

	* : rUnits and vUnits become methods, get JS bindings

2005-03-30 01:45  staikos

	* : added PSD binding

2005-03-29 23:29  staikos

	* : rewrite bind_string to match the other bindings

2005-03-29 23:26  staikos

	* : apply curve hint fix to PSDs also

2005-03-29 23:19  staikos

	* : fix curve hints for equations: they were going stale

2005-03-29 22:24  staikos

	* : Add binding for equations

2005-03-29 22:05  staikos

	* : add const

2005-03-29 21:59  staikos

	* : C&P error

2005-03-29 21:53  staikos

	* : typo

2005-03-29 21:40  staikos

	* : template for creating bindings

2005-03-29 21:30  staikos

	* : refactoring as much as possible - now all object bindings use
	  the new table (and enable-final should come close to working here
	  again)

2005-03-29 21:23  arwalker

	* : Use AUTOBORDER as the default setting for the the y-axis, else
	  there is no way to return to the plot as it is originally drawn.
	  Fix indentation.

2005-03-29 21:04  arwalker

	* : The usual (3.3 -> 3.1)

2005-03-29 19:50  staikos

	* : make the properties show up (to be refactored again)

2005-03-29 19:18  staikos

	* : use a table to generate the properties too (will propagate to
	  other bindings later)

2005-03-29 18:45  netterfield

	* : vector dialog can now create and edit S vectors as well as R
	  vectors.

2005-03-29 18:14  staikos

	* : some refactoring, a bug fix, and make tagName and other
	  properties real properties instead of function calls

2005-03-29 17:24  staikos

	* : fix update regression from recent commits

2005-03-29 16:55  staikos

	* : update to reflect where it's at

2005-03-29 16:51  staikos

	* : more error checking, another method, and more constructors for
	  datavector

2005-03-29 16:38  staikos

	* : various fixes, and add a relatively complete binding for
	  KstRVector.

2005-03-29 16:30  staikos

	* : don't try to set the tag name ourself - results in invalid
	  tagnames

2005-03-29 15:32  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typos and i18n plural-form usage.

2005-03-29 08:04  staikos

	* : data source binding - only able to list and load data sources at
	  this point

2005-03-29 07:21  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2005-03-29 07:10  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-03-29 07:09  staikos

	* : fix kjsembed test

2005-03-29 06:21  staikos

	* : spec patch from Matt Truch

2005-03-29 06:19  staikos

	* : add bindings for strings and the string list and fix a few
	  buglets

2005-03-29 06:06  staikos

	* : implement .length since we implement array indexing -> length()
	  is renamed to size() to avoid conflict

2005-03-29 05:50  staikos

	* : KstScalar and KstVector are now roughly "done" the binding
	  process.

2005-03-29 05:47  staikos

	* : set dirty flag when it's modified. we can't set the dirty flag
	  on changes to contents though. We have two choices: 1) manually
	  set it when modifying a vector 2) always set dirty whenever
	  value() is called Right now I choose 1

2005-03-29 05:17  staikos

	* : resize() added, more exceptions added

2005-03-29 04:59  staikos

	* : indexing for vectors - to set and get values

2005-03-29 03:54  staikos

	* : - add the vector and scalar lists - create objects for scalars -
	  add ability to get pointers to vectors and scalars

2005-03-29 02:53  staikos

	* : work on vectors

2005-03-29 01:46  staikos

	* : refactoring the libraries

2005-03-28 22:30  staikos

	* : looks like this is the approach to take for doing the Kst
	  bindings. This creates a Vector binding with a length() method
	  that returns nothing presently

2005-03-28 19:46  staikos

	* : update kjsembed, removing qcanvas support

2005-03-28 18:32  arwalker

	* : Correctly display row/col information.

2005-03-28 18:18  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolete commented-out code.

2005-03-28 05:44  staikos

	* : temporary hack to force images to be updated

2005-03-28 04:45  staikos

	* : update to match API changes

2005-03-28 04:39  staikos

	* : update testcase for new update behaviour

2005-03-28 04:36  staikos

	* : - add const - re-add methods that were removed

2005-03-28 04:21  staikos

	* : - add const - update providers and properly signify change in
	  strings and scalars

2005-03-28 04:07  staikos

	* : more notes

2005-03-28 03:34  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-03-28 03:17  staikos

	* : we weren't always getting the updates here since we changed the
	  way updates and paints work

2005-03-28 03:16  staikos

	* : fix a race in the update hack

2005-03-28 03:16  staikos

	* : this can be const

2005-03-28 03:13  staikos

	* : fix updates of histograms

2005-03-27 19:34  staikos

	* : revertlast - too quick on the commit

2005-03-27 19:27  staikos

	* : revertlast

2005-03-27 19:27  staikos

	* : fix indenting and from the docs: /* Does locking for you
	  automatically. */ template<class T, class S>
	  KstObjectList<KstSharedPtr<S> >
	  kstObjectSubList(KstObjectList<KstSharedPtr<T> >& list) {

2005-03-25 20:29  arwalker

	* : Make compatible with 3.1

2005-03-25 20:15  arwalker

	* : Add ability to edit an existing matrix from the matrix selector.

2005-03-25 19:35  arwalker

	* : Standardize include file layout

2005-03-25 19:17  staikos

	* : fixes to come in these places

2005-03-25 19:10  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT note to self

2005-03-25 19:09  arwalker

	* : Will need for consistency (ability to edit a matrix from the
	  matrix selector)

2005-03-25 18:38  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolete functions Don't resize vector and reallocate
	  memory unless necessary Don't call update on created vectors

2005-03-25 18:11  staikos

	* : start of matrices from plugins

2005-03-25 18:09  staikos

	* : matrices in plugins

2005-03-25 17:57  staikos

	* : Finish the code here BUG: 102382 BUG: 102386

2005-03-24 21:41  arwalker

	* : Add ability to view raw matrix values.

2005-03-24 18:45  arwalker

	* : 3.3 -> 3.1

2005-03-24 06:15  netterfield

	* : save uses indent update(-1) replaced by setDirty(true)
	  kstvector::generatevector sets saveable to false

2005-03-23 05:14  netterfield

	* : Starting to fix equations. Step 1: introduce svectors, which are
	  static vectors defined over a certain range. The vectorDialog can
	  also create them. They save and load. But -vectorDialog can't edit
	  them yet -data manager doesn't know about them yet. CCBUG:101214

2005-03-23 04:27  staikos

	* : oops, found even more memory usage in there

2005-03-23 04:26  staikos

	* : correction to previous commit: 1) catch other case of PSDs 2)
	  fix calculation of memory used by a PSD

2005-03-23 04:14  staikos

	* : Add PSDs to the memory check algorithm in the data wizard and
	  also add a check for the malloc() in KstVector::KstVector,
	  temporary until Kst2 when isValid() becomes KstObject-wide. We
	  need this check for javascript too, even though it's an ugly hack
	  and gives somewhat unexpected behaviour in the case that malloc
	  fails BUG: 102222

2005-03-23 04:04  staikos

	* : doc updates

2005-03-23 03:40  staikos

	* : How to fix 102221 properly, but not really fully or properly
	  done. There's lots of tweaking to be done, especially on the UI
	  side. We should stop the resize at minimumSize(), for instance.
	  There are also some interesting hacks in there. BUG: 102221

2005-03-23 01:48  staikos

	* : show Ready BUG: 102220

2005-03-22 05:17  staikos

	* : - parent the dialogs so they don't fall behind - finally fix the
	  very nasty-to-fix bug where reloading plugins didn't reload the UI
	  BUG: 74230

2005-03-21 15:20  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-03-21 03:37  staikos

	* : use KMDI's own size hint BUG: 101725

2005-03-21 02:12  staikos

	* : oooops. fix reference counting

2005-03-21 02:01  staikos

	* : Object dependency fixes - scalars in particular, plus other
	  random fixes CCBUG: 93037

2005-03-21 00:19  staikos

	* : missed changing one call

2005-03-20 21:11  staikos

	* : If compiled with benchmarking, it now dumps the count of the
	  number of times each plot was redrawn on exit. With this we could
	  develop a nice testcase to show when we add new draws that we
	  shouldn't have.

2005-03-20 20:19  staikos

	* : add more caching to kstlabel and add debug messages to
	  illustrate a major performance problem in Kst2DPlot for both
	  painting and drawing cases.

2005-03-20 19:23  staikos

	* : cache and reorder to squeeze out a few cycles, and add benchmark
	  hooks to show the performance problem with painting

2005-03-20 17:45  staikos

	* : Kst is now safe for processing events in this manner (we do it
	  elsewhere too). No need for these classes anymore. Also hide the
	  progress bar when we're done with it.

2005-03-18 21:09  staikos

	* : allow equations in the scalar editor

2005-03-18 20:40  staikos

	* : refactor to reuse later

2005-03-18 20:23  staikos

	* : I'm stunned that no-one hit this race already. Protect the
	  equation parser.

2005-03-18 19:11  staikos

	* : make setDirty() more implicit

2005-03-18 19:07  staikos

	* : die P_DATA die!!

2005-03-18 18:50  staikos

	* : change the default paint mechanism to P_PAINT from P_DATA and
	  introduce a hack to the update thread to pass the list of changed
	  curves in the event. Kst2DPlot is a mess and too dangerous to put
	  into the update thread right now. This hack will go away when
	  Kst2DPlot gets cleaned up. BUG: 95117

2005-03-18 17:38  arwalker

	* : Check Qt version rather than KDE version

2005-03-18 17:33  arwalker

	* : Re-enable Edit...Copy functionality after changes to
	  plotmimesource.cpp CCMAIL: 96256@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-18 15:35  staikos

	* : use XPM for backward compat

2005-03-18 02:40  staikos

	* : make it Qt 3.1 compatible

2005-03-18 02:16  staikos

	* : updated

2005-03-18 02:09  staikos

	* : progress dialog added

2005-03-18 01:37  staikos

	* : fix EPS output: mimetype is image/x-eps, not
	  application/postscript also draw only the dragged plots for image
	  output

2005-03-18 00:30  arwalker

	* : Fix compile errors for KDE 3.1

2005-03-17 22:07  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2005-03-17 22:01  staikos

2005-03-17 01:00  arwalker

	* : Fix compiler warning.

2005-03-17 00:42  arwalker

	* : Add const.

2005-03-17 00:30  staikos

	* : fixme

2005-03-16 23:58  staikos

	* : updates

2005-03-16 23:12  arwalker

	* : Replace deprecated KAccel::stringToKey()

2005-03-16 22:37  arwalker

	* : Add mime types of PNG, JPG, and EPS when dragging and dropping.
	  For now only the entire window is handled.

2005-03-16 22:13  staikos

	* : update changes for kstvector - just minor reworking for the new
	  update model

2005-03-16 22:09  staikos

	* : don't let the view widget get too small

2005-03-16 17:54  staikos

	* : enable compilation of netcdf support (resulting plugin untested)

2005-03-16 16:07  staikos

	* : new ideas

2005-03-16 15:32  staikos

	* : proposed changes to the update counter

2005-03-16 01:19  staikos

	* : first big benefit of new update scheme: plugins only update when
	  their dependencies update now.

2005-03-16 00:43  staikos

	* : Well we still need these anyway, so let's leave them here.

2005-03-16 00:08  staikos

	* : Only update when dependencies update or when forced to update

2005-03-15 23:56  staikos

	* : rework update to not trigger if the input vector isn't updated
	  and a force doesn't happen.

2005-03-15 23:36  staikos

	* : force a crash (assert) when size=0 happens so we can trace it
	  down.

2005-03-15 23:35  staikos

	* : Fix two mistakes in previous commit: 1) updating the equation
	  now updates the vectors used so we don't need to do it explicitly
	  (although no harm...) 2) xVector update was not happening

2005-03-15 23:17  arwalker

	* : Prevent a crash that results when trying to draw into a null
	  pixmap. This can happen when a plot takes up either zero width or
	  zero height in a window.

2005-03-15 23:11  staikos

	* : rework equation update: 1) update VectorsUsed first (!!) 2) only
	  FillY when the vectors used have changed, the x vector has
	  changed, or a forced update happens 3) Return a proper return code

2005-03-15 23:04  arwalker

	* : Limit number of columns to the same number as is supported in
	  the user interface (i.e. 10).

2005-03-15 22:02  arwalker

	* : Obsolete

2005-03-15 22:02  arwalker

	* : Allow drag and drop between windows.

2005-03-15 20:22  staikos

	* : - fix indenting in KstHistogram::update() (remove tabs, etc) -
	  implement the cached update result as best as can be done without
	  reworking the update algorithms - implement KstViewObject::update
	  - de-inline some virtual methods and add setDirty() to them (much
	  more work to do here) This amounts to almost nothing visible, but
	  I'm committing now in the interest of making changes
	  incrementally.

2005-03-15 19:53  staikos

	* : The root of my frustrations with update() right now

2005-03-15 19:11  arwalker

	* : Add ability to copy a single plot to the clipboard from the
	  layout popup menu.

2005-03-15 01:33  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to use copy and paste plots using the clipboard.
	  The copy functionality operates only on selected plots in layout
	  mode. The paste functionality operaties only in layout mode.

2005-03-14 20:23  staikos

	* : add d pointer implementation and two variables for use in the
	  update reworking

2005-03-14 19:57  staikos

	* : some more details

2005-03-14 02:28  staikos

	* : forgot to add this before

2005-03-12 00:17  arwalker

	* : Enable timezone settings for KDE dates.

2005-03-12 00:08  arwalker

	* : Implement support for KDE formatted dates and times. CCMAIL:
	  101130-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-11 21:14  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-03-11 21:13  staikos

	* : just to clarify

2005-03-11 20:40  staikos

	* : re-enable compile of KJS extension

2005-03-11 20:23  staikos

	* : 3.1

2005-03-11 20:13  staikos

	* : er something didn't sound right

2005-03-11 20:13  staikos

	* : fail on editable scalars

2005-03-11 20:03  staikos

	* : restore indenting and remove commented code that was moved to
	  .ui file to avoid confusion

2005-03-11 19:45  staikos

	* : revertlast, re-apply relevant portion of patch

2005-03-11 19:40  arwalker

	* : Make resize more elegantly and make borders consistent with
	  other UI elements.

2005-03-11 19:08  arwalker

	* : Add ability to quickly copy a plot from one window to another in
	  layout mode.

2005-03-11 19:07  arwalker

	* : Indentation correction. Barth, any possibilty you could get your
	  editor to replace tabs with spaces.

2005-03-11 18:56  staikos

	* : notes on the plan for modifying updates

2005-03-11 18:56  staikos

	* : major work on scripting - a new console is created which can be
	  run inside or outside of Kst, along with descriptions of bindings
	  and some minor reworkings

2005-03-11 17:12  netterfield

	* : BUG: Parent the window name dialog so data object dialogs don't
	  get burried Add default histogram labels Improve psd labels Make
	  default plot names from command line consistent with other naming
	  schemes

2005-03-10 22:53  arwalker

	* : Make compatible with KDE 3.1 CVS_SILENT

2005-03-10 22:46  arwalker

	* : Make it possible to edit scalars. CCMAIL:
	  95031-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-10 21:14  arwalker

	* : Couldn't find these in CVS already.

2005-03-10 20:43  arwalker

	* : Remove duplicate connections causing scalar text to be added
	  twice to event monitor.

2005-03-10 19:51  mueller

	* : go away

2005-03-10 19:44  arwalker

	* : Correct indentation.

2005-03-10 19:26  arwalker

	* : When run from the command line, if curves are created one per
	  plot, then label the plots P<n>-<y> where <n> is some integer (as
	  before) and <y> is the name of the y-vector in some simple curve.
	  All other cases remain as before. CCMAIL: 94346-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-10 18:37  arwalker

	* : KCalendarSystem obsolete

2005-03-10 18:18  arwalker

	* : Try and fail more gracefully if files or vectors do not exist.
	  Report these problems to the user through KstDebug.

2005-03-10 13:53  adridg

	* : Workarounds for inconsistent include path handling in various
	  headers; immediate trigger was kmdichildview.h:42:32: kst/k
	  st/kst_export.h: No such file or directory

2005-03-10 03:42  netterfield

	* : CONST_PI now uses M_PI in math.h Add a couple more constants
	  useful for deg to radian conversions.

2005-03-09 16:02  netterfield

	* : Script definition cleanup.

2005-03-09 11:24  netterfield

	* : -Add a new autoscale mode which leaves a 5% border - this is now
	  the what 'm' gives you in Y. -Fix data wizard tracking of regid
	  settings for windows.

2005-03-09 01:07  arwalker

	* : Added ability to define timezone for time-interpreted axes that
	  are displayed as dates.

2005-03-08 21:21  staikos

	* : typo

2005-03-08 21:17  staikos

	* : notes about scripting, and an example

2005-03-08 17:55  staikos

	* : Appear where we want it to appear in the menus BUG: 99552

2005-03-07 21:47  arwalker

	* : Added "sticky" borders when resizing. Reduced the distance to
	  stick by half. Implemented as per some sort of vague consensus.
	  CCMAIL: 85732-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-07 20:40  arwalker

	* : Fix a problem when resizing a plot, that could cause overlapping
	  text because the internalAlignment algorithm was using the cached
	  font sizes, rather than the new font sizes.

2005-03-07 20:01  arwalker

	* : Correct indentation

2005-03-07 09:05  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-03-06 14:28  adridg

	* : --enable-final: identifiers need to be unique across object
	  files too; the static QString looks scary and superfluous anyway
	  -- what about making it non-static, like the one in for fit?

2005-03-05 21:29  netterfield

	* : New rules for default labels for curves: -get rid of file name
	  in top label - it is generally not useful. -For 1-3 curves,
	  v->label() in Y axes, otherwise, default to legend box on.

2005-03-05 13:56  netterfield

	* : Some changes to auto-labels for PSD's;

2005-03-04 23:18  netterfield

	* : Revert to Andrew's original fix, but leave 1.25 * line
	  spacing...

2005-03-04 22:58  arwalker

	* : Implement sticky borders. Do we want to make it configurable
	  (switch on/off, distance to snap, etc.)? Do we also want it to
	  apply to resizing, or just moving, as requested in the bug report?
	  CCMAIL: 85732@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-04 22:51  netterfield

	* : The position of the X axis should have nothing to do with the
	  height of the Y Tick labels. We need to add 1.5 x YLabel height
	  for 1.5 line spacing, which I think looks nice.

2005-03-04 19:48  netterfield

	* : Changing the #plot cols selects re-grid Add icons for new
	  events, images, and plugins.

2005-03-04 19:17  arwalker

	* : We want to remember the line width even if lines are disabled as
	  the line width (now called weight) also impacts the point size.
	  Also, we want to store line and point settings (even if not
	  currently used) as they still give the last used setting, which
	  the user might want to retain across sessions. CCMAIL:
	  98560-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-04 02:34  arwalker

	* : Clean up the x-axis and y-axis labels. Should also prevent
	  overlapping of labels on the x-axis. 97395_done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-03 23:28  arwalker

	* : Better handle drawing of histogram lines when the width is
	  greater than 0.

2005-03-03 23:00  arwalker

	* : Previously the min/max values for the histogram properties would
	  be incorrectly reported as they did not account for the width of a
	  bar. Thus, if you opened the Edit Histogram dialog and hit OK the
	  min/max values would change even though you hadn't modified any
	  values. This has been fixed. CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 22:05  staikos

	* : The reason they're deprecated is because they don't associate
	  their dialogs with the caller widget. 0L just circumvents the
	  warning without fixing the problem. Unfortunately it can't be
	  fixed in kstdatasource at this point because it's part of the
	  library. Will solve this later with a static of some sort.

2005-03-03 19:53  arwalker

	* : Handle deprecated mehods.

2005-03-03 19:38  arwalker

	* : Keep compatibility with earlier versions of KDE. CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 19:32  arwalker

	* : Handle some more deprecated methods.

2005-03-03 19:15  arwalker

	* : Requires kdeversion.h

2005-03-03 18:52  arwalker

	* : KLineEditDlg has been deprecated. CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 17:20  arwalker

	* : More efficient when axis in date interpreted mode.

2005-03-03 16:55  arwalker

	* : Sort the legend alignment in the more logical left, center,
	  right order.

2005-03-03 05:27  staikos

	* : Another place where comment delimiters were hardcoded, and
	  significantly reduce the readField loop in cpu cycles (one less
	  condition, and no memset())

2005-03-03 04:56  arwalker

	* : Required for icons in data manager.

2005-03-03 04:51  arwalker

	* : Add icons to the New... buttons to make things more consistent.

2005-03-03 04:47  staikos

	* : cleanup KstScalar for future work

2005-03-03 03:33  arwalker

	* : Y axis interpretation changes.

2005-03-03 01:22  staikos

	* : ah, also don't permit the user to even try to use stdin in this
	  dialog

2005-03-03 00:28  staikos

	* : data wizard with stdin doesn't really make sense

2005-03-03 00:21  staikos

	* : use KstSettings for printer settings, and remove obsolete delay
	  code.

2005-03-02 23:52  staikos

	* : no longer true due to previous fixes

2005-03-02 23:46  staikos

	* : add support for functions with != 1 argument, but we don't have
	  any, so they're unused.

2005-03-02 23:31  staikos

	* : refactor to eliminate two copies of the interpolation code. It's
	  not what I would call pretty, but at least there's no chance of
	  any performance hit.

2005-03-02 23:05  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-03-02 23:04  staikos

	* : add a Negative node so that printing out the tree is "pretty"

2005-03-02 22:36  staikos

	* : match changes in the parser

2005-03-02 22:36  staikos

	* : equation objects now automatically detect changes in vector
	  names and rewrite the equation accordingly. Some formatting is
	  lost, but in general it seems to work. Causes a small performance
	  hit on saving equations since they are reparsed and then the tree
	  is walked. Required changing collectVectors to use a map instead
	  of a list. Negatives are temporarily a bit broken

2005-03-02 22:34  arwalker

	* : Integrate histograms and psds better into the delayed loading
	  mechanism.

2005-03-02 22:07  arwalker

	* : Don't bother to update an invalid object as we're about to
	  delete it.

2005-03-02 21:52  staikos

	* : spacing in debug message

2005-03-02 21:24  arwalker

	* : KStaticDeleter::setObject(type *obj, bool isArray = false ) is
	  deprecated.

2005-03-02 20:21  arwalker

	* : Add ability to specify time interpretation on the y-axis.
	  96761-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-02 02:33  staikos

	* : iteration works better this way

2005-03-02 02:32  staikos

	* : added another testcase, updated results

2005-03-02 02:26  staikos

	* : nodes now keep track of parentheses (collapsed to one at most)
	  and spit them out in text() where needed. (-x) is broken -> gives
	  (0-x). May need to introduce a negative node to fix this properly.
	  also fixed parser to work with bison 1.875

2005-03-02 00:36  staikos

	* : This flattens equations to text, but there are two problems: 1)
	  whitespace is lost (minor) 2) parentheses are lost (major)
	  Solutions seem to be: i) make a tree walker instead and have it
	  know about order of operations, inserting parentheses where needed
	  (painful) ii) store parentheses flag in each node (somewhat heavy)

2005-03-02 00:21  arwalker

	* : Cleanup. CVS_SILENT

2005-03-01 22:54  arwalker

	* : Use _ to denote member variables of class. CVS_SILENT

2005-03-01 20:47  netterfield

	* : BUG: The wrong tab in the plot dialog would be opened upon
	  clicking on a label or on the axes in a plot. This fixes that.

2005-02-28 21:10  netterfield

	* : More changes to tag naming. In particular, preserve "-sv"
	  suffixes which were set in 1.0.0.

2005-02-28 01:27  mueller

	* : fix visibility

2005-02-26 14:19  waba

	* : "KDE Desktop Entry" is deprecated

2005-02-24 18:26  staikos

	* : more work on time including some fixes, and rudimentary support
	  in ascii files. you can now take an ascii file with INDEX assumed
	  to be 0s...ns and ask for starting at "3 minutes" or last "1 hour"

2005-02-23 05:08  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-02-21 09:19  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-02-17 20:30  staikos

	* : Sorry Barth, can't remove -sv since it breaks existing .kst
	  files CCMAIL: matt@truch.net

2005-02-17 19:56  staikos

	* : dump the list of problematic objects to make it easier to debug
	  a broken .kst file

2005-02-11 18:21  arwalker

	* : Add condtional compile for RaNA.

2005-02-11 00:04  arwalker

	* : RaNA now depends on GSL. Add gain and linearity. CVS_SILENT

2005-02-10 23:36  staikos

	* : oops

2005-02-10 23:35  staikos

	* : Fix the link to the webpage and update copyright to 2005

2005-02-10 23:14  staikos

	* : add the ability to parse nested brackets in order to implement
	  96334 and other related features

2005-02-10 21:07  arwalker

	* : Cleanup of code. CVS_SILENT

2005-02-10 20:16  staikos

	* : unused variable

2005-02-10 20:07  staikos

	* : add testrvector and testvector

2005-02-10 17:54  arwalker

	* : Fix compile errors.

2005-02-10 03:07  netterfield

	* : Auto Tag Names: -Make vectors, curves, equations, psds &
	  histograms use KST::suggest*Name() everywhere for auto-names -try
	  a new naming scheme (easy to change now that everthing is
	  concentrated in kstdefaultnames.cpp TODO: plugins, matrixes, and
	  Images

2005-02-09 18:15  staikos

	* : better to use findGroup()

2005-02-09 18:06  staikos

	* : add the binary search code for finding time indices in planck
	  objects

2005-02-09 15:36  staikos

	* : some utility functions to be used later

2005-02-08 23:25  staikos

	* : add my idea for a dcop interface for the js extension. more to
	  come

2005-02-08 22:58  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT note to self

2005-02-08 22:26  staikos

	* : new PSDs should not interpret as time by default BUG: 96760

2005-02-08 21:18  staikos

	* : X axis interpretation in PSD cases from the data wizard is
	  disabled initially Still one more place to fix this CCBUG: 96760

2005-02-08 16:05  staikos

	* : Remember the last active window and restore it. Remembers it
	  with a node in <windowsize> which maybe isn't completely ideal,
	  but it's easier than storing an <active/> node in the window since
	  that would require iterating through the windows and storing a
	  flag, or walking the XML again. Maybe we'll get to clean the XML
	  up one day and fix this then. Also cleans up KstApp::inst(), app,
	  and parent() usage to be uniform. FEATURE: 98559

2005-02-08 06:50  staikos

	* : compile

2005-02-08 05:57  staikos

	* : fix off-by-one in geometry calculations that caused objects to
	  be 1 pixel too large in each dimension

2005-02-08 03:29  staikos

	* : repair loading from relative paths

2005-02-08 03:23  staikos

	* : display (x0,y0)-(x1,y1) when moving and resizing objects to make
	  it easier to line things up FEATURE: 98821

2005-02-08 03:05  staikos

	* : Add support for data sources via KIO. FEATURE: 85594

2005-02-08 01:46  staikos

	* : add netcdf source by Nicolas Brisset. Not in the build yet
	  because it probably doesn't build as-is without autoconf magic

2005-02-08 00:54  staikos

	* : seems to fix Skip alignment errors? Please reopen with a new
	  testcase if there are still problems BUG: 98515

2005-02-06 20:13  staikos

	* : avoid shell errors

2005-02-06 19:56  staikos

	* : kdemacros.h is fairly new too

2005-02-06 01:57  mueller

	* : fix compile with KDE < 3.4

2005-02-05 19:34  mueller

	* : fix export's

2005-02-02 03:13  staikos

	* : only do this if SPF=1 Will most likely break cases where SPF !=
	  1 now. Testcases appreciated.

2005-02-02 01:13  staikos

	* : fix the data source for the new skip behaviour

2005-02-02 00:21  arwalker

	* : Add linearity, gain, and isolation. Only the UI - functionality
	  remains to be implemented.

2005-02-01 23:32  staikos

	* : better put these comments in before I forget

2005-02-01 23:17  staikos

	* : Adjust skip based on comments and patches over the past couple
	  of weeks. Accelerated skip is probably broken.

2005-02-01 19:29  staikos

	* : merge the time input branch into head. It's not complete, but
	  it's roughly as usable as the previous code. Input of equations
	  should work.

2005-01-31 21:43  staikos

	* : fix compile

2005-01-31 03:06  staikos

	* : call load()

2005-01-31 03:05  staikos

	* : implement a load() virtual to tell the widget to load its
	  settings.

2005-01-31 02:35  staikos

	* : use the per-instance configurator where possible

2005-01-31 02:35  staikos

	* : - add ability to save data source configs for specific instances
	  (note: this would have to be done via XML) - add a d-ptr and
	  commit to BC for the next release

2005-01-29 00:47  arwalker

	* : Added Receiver Input Offset for RaNA.

2005-01-28 12:29  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typo.

2005-01-27 23:11  arwalker

	* : Add first of RaNA (LFI specific) functionality.

2005-01-27 00:06  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT designer style indenting

2005-01-26 23:16  arwalker

2005-01-25 19:23  coolo

2005-01-25 18:32  arwalker

2005-01-21 18:57  staikos

	* : designer style indenting

2005-01-21 18:36  netterfield

	* : FEATURE: The vector selector widget also has a edit vector
	  button, to easily edit a vector when selecting it. The icon still
	  needs to be changed.

2005-01-21 11:33  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected inconsistency (user name -> username in

2005-01-21 06:58  staikos

2005-01-21 04:08  staikos

	* : this test completely doesn't work. I think it's Qt's fault or

	* : memory error - might reintroduce an off-by-one bug but the
	  previous fix was definitely wrong in at least some cases.

2005-01-20 03:34  staikos

	* : Fix the proximity check for double click in log mode

2005-01-20 02:29  staikos

2005-01-19 23:30  staikos

	* : add the tutorial data with a gross hack of a Makefile

2005-01-19 23:12  staikos

	* : Double click near a curve (within 5 pixels) opens an editor for
	  the best-guessed properties of that curve. For instance, equation
	  editor, PSD editor, Plugin editor, or curve editor. There is a
	  little bug with log plots I think. Blast folks say this is
	  sufficient as an alternative for clicking on the legend. FEATURE:

2005-01-19 20:00  netterfield

	* : Fix error bars

	  - add dcop interfaces to change files for vectors FEATURE: 96445

2005-01-19 00:32  staikos

	* : no longer proposed, since we shipped them in 1.0 :)

2005-01-18 23:55  staikos

	* : workaround for Qt 3.1

2005-01-18 02:58  staikos

	* : install the fonts in a place that we can install them
	  system-wide from

2005-01-18 02:49  staikos

	* : x.org symbol fonts

2005-01-18 02:35  staikos

	* : If you fix a bug in something we have a regression test for, add
	  a testcase so that we don't have a regression there.

2005-01-18 02:24  staikos

	* : update coverage documentation, and add more testcases

2005-01-17 22:52  staikos

	* : restore const fix

2005-01-17 22:49  staikos

	* : this was supposed to be commented out.

2005-01-17 22:48  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2005-01-17 22:48  staikos

	* : merge fastskip branch into HEAD. Only makes a difference for
	  piolib use. Branch remains open to come up with a solution for
	  doing boxcar inside the datasource if we care.

2005-01-17 22:32  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2005-01-17 22:30  staikos

	* : more testcases for ascii

2005-01-17 21:05  staikos

	* : adding tests for rvectors. This is a big test suite that hasn't
	  been filled in yet. There are methods for each data source, and a
	  section for generic RVector tests. Ascii has some rudimentary
	  tests, and already two fail, though it's debatable if they're
	  correct or not.

2005-01-17 20:34  staikos

	* : restore designer style indenting

2005-01-17 19:51  staikos

	* : manpage stuff

2005-01-17 09:18  staikos

	* : datasource-internal skip is rapidly stabilizing, but this was
	  incomplete so it needs to be removed before merging kstrvector
	  back into HEAD

2005-01-17 09:15  staikos

	* : off-by-one

2005-01-17 09:03  staikos

	* : skip with piolib gives the right results now, but is still
	  updating too often

2005-01-17 08:17  staikos

	* : fix some bugs in skipping - still there is one little error

2005-01-17 07:15  staikos

	* : add double-click handler

2005-01-17 04:40  mueller

	* : ignore

2005-01-15 18:47  arwalker

	* : Add help messages for several translations. Modify creation of
	  lists to aid in translation.

2005-01-15 00:28  arwalker

	* : If you select to save a single vector the combobox at the bottom
	  of the Save Vectors to Disk is disabled. When a field is disabled
	  it should have no effect on the result. However, if the combobox
	  was set to "Save to seperate files" prior to being disabled the
	  saved file is <requested file>.1 else it is simply <requested
	  file> This patch fixes this problem and saves to the same filename
	  in all cases.

2005-01-15 00:19  arwalker

	* : Save something other than an empty file under KDE 3.2 and
	  earlier.

2005-01-14 23:45  arwalker

	* : George wants these translated.

2005-01-14 22:42  arwalker

	* : Improve previous fix. No need to translate couple of strings.

2005-01-14 22:07  arwalker

	* : Allow selection of only one radio button in the plot dialog
	  range tab. Enable and disable the edit fields accordingly.

2005-01-14 18:57  arwalker

	* : Fix compile error.

2005-01-14 18:11  staikos

	* : 3.1

2005-01-14 18:09  arwalker

	* : Prevent infinite recursion

2005-01-14 16:47  staikos

	* : I finally understand this code, and I don't like the API change
	  it made. The flag it added was a special-case hack and should not
	  have gone into the API of two classes that generally don't even
	  care about it. The real problem is even hidden by this hack: Out
	  updates don't trigger hierarchically yet, but this is a work in
	  progress, and once complete, this hack in kstplugin, and the
	  reason we have it in KstPSD can go away, along with
	  KstVector::setAllNew().

2005-01-14 15:21  netterfield

	* : Reworked plot dialog.

2005-01-14 15:07  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected a few typos (notifcation -> notification,
	  apsect -> aspect) and reworked one message to make it scan a
	  little better.

2005-01-14 08:15  staikos

	* : add skip support, though seems to not be quite right yet. Also
	  could be much more efficient with changes in piolib.

2005-01-14 04:03  staikos

	* : postpone cleanup() calls until after plots are created - reduces
	  code from O(n^3) to O(n^2) for creation of plots from the data
	  wizard.

2005-01-14 03:42  staikos

	* : pause updates while the data wizard is running to avoid an event
	  storm

2005-01-14 03:12  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT typos

2005-01-14 03:12  staikos

	* : cleanup - remove duplicated method sampleCount() in favour of
	  length(). Helps to differentiate vs curves anyway.

2005-01-13 18:25  arwalker

	* : Add const'ness to QDomElement

2005-01-13 17:45  arwalker

	* : Don't ask the user if they want to save if there are no windows
	  open, as there is little point in saving an empty kstt file. This
	  also has the added advantage that if you open a kst file, close
	  the window(s) and then close kst you can't inadvertently save an
	  empty kst file.

2005-01-12 18:03  netterfield

	* : build makefile

2005-01-12 03:49  staikos

	* : fix memory error (crash) introduced with new plot cleanup
	  algorithm. Discovered by regression tests.

2005-01-12 00:47  arwalker

	* : Restore the clipping region. This prevents the focus rectangle
	  associated with a plot that is a member of a group from being seen
	  through an overlying plot that is not a member of the group.

2005-01-11 22:21  staikos

	* : Copy constructor should take a const ref. Fix constness all over
	  the place. Delay instantiation of variables unless needed. I'm not
	  sure I like the idea of using a KstViewObject (KShared) by value
	  though.

2005-01-11 21:58  staikos

	* : unrevert my last commit please update before committing, which
	  lets CVS merge changes.

2005-01-11 21:56  arwalker

	* : Remove compiler warning

2005-01-11 21:52  staikos

	* : Remove conflicts

2005-01-11 21:46  arwalker

	* : Move the Copy functionality to the layout menu. Allow copying of

	* : reorganize kstrc

2005-01-11 20:33  staikos

	* : bye bye kstprintrc. Settings are lost because I don't see a
	  simple way to migrate them with kconf_update, and they're not
	  really important anyway. Now stored in kstrc [Printing]

2005-01-11 20:08  staikos

	* : hook in kconf_update and eliminate kstautosaverc

2005-01-11 19:23  staikos

	* : use KDE defaults for email settings, where available.

2005-01-11 15:47  staikos

	* : Unneeded dependencies CCMAIL: Claude Mercier
	  <claude.mercier@ias.u-psud.fr>

2005-01-11 08:29  staikos

	* : This is a bit of a fix for updating of hidden tabs. It avoids
	  painting or drawing tabs that aren't visible. It may be buggy so
	  feedback is appreciated. This stuff is very complex. Updating of
	  data objects that are "hidden" still happens since we don't really
	  know what is or is not hidden in the update thread. It also
	  requires much more complex dependency walking than we are even
	  capable of doing right now. I am going to close the bug as fixed
	  and leave the rest as "LATER" to be part of update redesign.
	  Reopen if tabs are still being painted when they shouldn't be, or
	  if this fix breaks things. BUG: 96764

2005-01-11 07:44  staikos

	* : add an abort() and do some very minor cleanups in prep for
	  kstrvector reworkings

2005-01-11 07:42  staikos

	* : start of a KstVector test class. Does a few things, but could
	  actually be incorrect at the moment (3 tests fail but I haven't
	  even looked to see why)

2005-01-11 07:24  staikos

	* : restore designer-style indenting on .ui.h files, fix a bug in
	  fft options widget that would make it give to messageboxes on
	  error or none if the first check was OK but the second wasn't, and
	  move #includes out of .ui.h files. They don't belong there.

2005-01-11 07:06  staikos

	* : set tab order

2005-01-11 06:54  staikos

	* : update the change state when clicking the X interpret checkbox.
	  cannot reproduce problems with the spinbox, and I'm sure I fixed
	  that a while ago. BUG: 96759

2005-01-10 20:11  staikos

	* : restore indentation for .ui.h

2005-01-10 18:16  netterfield

	  tests. Doesn't work yet....but compiles.

2005-01-08 03:52  arwalker

	* : Fix compile errors.

2005-01-07 23:21  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to easily copy a plot within the same window.
	  This can be useful to provide different views of the same data
	  very quickly. Some additional work could be done to: * offset the
	  copied plot with respect to the original (at the moment the copy
	  is placed directly over the original) * allow the plot to be
	  copied to a different window

2005-01-07 20:18  arwalker

	* : Fix problems with the Open Recent menu. The opened file is now
	  selected in the Open Recent menu even when it is opened from the
	  QuckStart dialog. No file is selected in the Open Recent menu
	  following a Close request.

2005-01-06 23:45  arwalker

	* : CCMAIL: 96441-done@bugs.kde.org I think this addresses the
	  problem. I've added an additional column to the list of vectors
	  which is the position of the vector in the list. Sorting is done
	  on this column by default, but can be changed by clicking on the
	  column header.

2005-01-06 19:50  arwalker

	* : Remove printf statements.

2005-01-06 19:44  arwalker

	* : Remove threading from email notifcation. CCMAIL:
	  88088@bugs.kde.org

2005-01-06 19:21  arwalker

	* : Get things compiling under KDE 3.1 KTempFile::sync() not
	  supported until KDE 3.3

2005-01-06 18:38  arwalker

	* : QString::reserve( ) only supported since Qt 3.2

2005-01-06 01:58  arwalker

	* : CCMAIL: 88088@bugs.kde.org Seems to be working okay, but not
	  tested with anything but the simplest SMTP server.

2005-01-06 01:54  arwalker

	* : Has served its purpose CVS_SILENT

2005-01-05 22:21  staikos

	* : fix uninitialized variable

2005-01-05 20:14  staikos

	* : needed part of previous commit. Oops. Made interpolate() const
	  and edit the data collection header.

2005-01-05 20:09  staikos

	* : interpolation support for saving vectors

2005-01-05 19:46  staikos

	* : implement saving to separate files, add a header to files with
	  only one vector, store at higher precision, and minor UI fix.
	  stubs added for interpolation

2005-01-05 19:24  arwalker

	* : Add E-Mail configuration to the Kst Settings dialog.

2005-01-05 19:22  arwalker

	* : Remove compiler warnings. Remove superfluous semi-colon.

2005-01-05 05:35  staikos

	* : the rest of the crashes in d2asc BUG: 96039

2005-01-05 05:31  staikos

	* : Fix most of the dirfile crash problems, but not all of it. It
	  crashes on exit now. CCBUG: 96039

2005-01-05 04:53  staikos

	* : use minimum length, not maximum

2005-01-05 04:45  staikos

	* : fix delimiter support

2005-01-05 04:43  staikos

	* : start to implement field list caching, and partially fix comment
	  detection

2005-01-05 04:29  staikos

	* : Make the vector save dialog capable of saving multiple vectors.
	  They are saved as columns to the same file, and a header is
	  written with the vector names. This exposes a bug in the ascii
	  reader which I will investigate next. FEATURE: 96235

2005-01-04 22:45  arwalker

	* : Here's what the email configuration for event notification will
	  look like (more or less anyway).

2005-01-04 20:52  arwalker

	* : Remove empty <tabstop> which was preventing loading in Qt
	  Designer 3.1

2005-01-04 19:47  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to specify asymmetric error bars. Be default the
	  same error values will be used in both the +ve and -ve directions.
	  If an older kst file is read in that supported only symmetric
	  error bars then the same error values will be used in both the +ve
	  and -ve directions. If an older version of kst reads in a kst file
	  that uses asymmetric error bars then only the +ve value will be
	  honoured and will be used for both +ve and -ve values. CCMAIL:
	  96236-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-28 20:57  arwalker

	* : Its not sufficient to call updatePlotList() when the window is
	  changed by the user, as this does not update the settings for the
	  selected plot. This changes also updates the plot settings.

2004-12-27 03:06  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-12-27 03:04  staikos

	* : back to devel

2004-12-27 02:19  staikos

	* : fix test1.sh and prepare 1.1.0 developer release 1

2004-12-23 23:30  staikos

	* : revert last. Hopefully hasn't messed up translations too much. I
	  am reverting this commit because the behaviour will be changed to
	  work in a plural sense very soon now, and I don't want to break
	  translations for this now.

2004-12-23 16:16  staikos

	* : fix piolib build again

2004-12-23 02:17  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolete checks in datamode. Remove unnecessary paint.

2004-12-22 18:42  arwalker

	* : Make layout spacing and margin consistent with other dialogs.
	  Rename menu item to "Save Vector to Disk" (from "Save Vectors to
	  Disk") as only one vector can be saved at a time. Rename dialog to
	  match menu item.

2004-12-22 18:28  arwalker

	* : Resize more gracefully.

2004-12-22 18:21  arwalker

	* : Remove compiler warnings.

2004-12-22 18:01  arwalker

	* : Remove some unnecessary calculations. Fix problem with line
	  position for overlapping (i.e. located at same pixel on x-axis)
	  data points.

2004-12-21 23:38  staikos

	* : - don't destroy what the user has already input when a dialog
	  update happens - fix a deadlock regression similar to the previous
	  changefile deadlock, but in the data manager on delete

2004-12-21 18:36  staikos

	* : fix reentrancy deadlock in almost all uses of this dialog BUG:
	  95591

2004-12-21 17:02  netterfield

	* : Updated histogram test.

2004-12-21 16:30  netterfield

	* : BUG: Images could not be loaded from .kst files. This fixes
	  that. Discussion: The bug appears to come in with the introduction
	  of lazy loading data objects: The plots attempt to draw the image
	  before the matrixes have been loaded and added to the image. What
	  I don't understand is why this doesn't happen w/ curves -
	  apparently, the problem is being solved in a different way for
	  curves/vectors than for Images/Matrixes.

2004-12-21 05:25  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-12-21 05:25  staikos

	* : printf->kdDebug() and place a marker for regression testing

2004-12-20 20:33  arwalker

	* : Make datamode considerably more efficient by not repainting the
	  entire window every time the datamode marker is updated.

2004-12-20 16:28  netterfield

	* : BUG: data object dialogs were not being updated on <new>. This
	  fixes that.

2004-12-20 09:14  staikos

	* : some comparisons for the way latex renders these, vs the way we
	  do. The new parser parses the same way latex does, so rendering
	  should easily be the same once the new renderer is done. This can
	  be used for font size comparison too.

2004-12-20 01:20  staikos

	* : Update the datamode marker when scrolling and zooming BUG:
	  95413, 95412

2004-12-20 00:18  staikos

	* : remove this check because it's going into admin/ soon

2004-12-19 17:59  staikos

	* : fix crash in equation parser, and add more error messages.
	  Sometimes we get a bit confused on errors and give an error that
	  isn't entirely true, but it's really not so bad.

2004-12-18 21:59  arwalker

	* : Make sum and int a little more legible in the code.

2004-12-18 21:36  arwalker

	* : Correctly display omicron, upsilon, xi and theta.

2004-12-18 05:41  netterfield

	* : BUG: dataobject dialogs did not update before show. Now they do.

2004-12-17 23:34  staikos

	* : revert the datamode "fix" again

2004-12-17 23:25  staikos

	* : - Make timer configuration a compile-time configuration, with a
	  generated .h that can be editted without worry of accidentally
	  committing it. - Also start the skip mode in the ascii plugin.
	  INDEX should work.

2004-12-17 23:00  netterfield

	* : BUG: Data wizard layout cleanup was broken for new windows. This
	  fixes it. Temp. get rid of debug statements.

2004-12-17 20:15  netterfield

	* : -make update dialogs not update hidden dialogs by default -make
	  registerDocChange() call update dialogs.

2004-12-17 19:57  staikos

	* : two more pseudo-failures, but also a Kst crash

2004-12-17 16:31  staikos

	* : revert datamode fix for now because zoom boxes are more
	  important.

2004-12-17 05:10  staikos

	* : factor out some d2i()s. unfortunately I later discovered that
	  these are not in the hot path for the common case.

2004-12-17 05:01  netterfield

	* : BUG: 95211 After recent changes, the renderer was sometimes
	  using the bounding box of "0123456789" for height, and sometimes
	  using height = ascent + decent +1 for height... This uses the
	  latter definition for all cases. So now, top alignment is with the
	  top of the highest accent allowed in the font, and bottom
	  alignment is with the lowest decender. This has additionally
	  required some re-tweaking of kst2dplot label placement. Still more
	  could be useful, but not tonight.

2004-12-16 23:14  staikos

	* : keep the mouse coordinates in sync

2004-12-16 21:04  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolste functions. Allow user to maintain aspect ratio
	  of window when printing. Remember last used settings when
	  printing. Allow user to specify orientation and paper size.

2004-12-16 19:21  staikos

	* : since we're compatibility committed, let's start marking these
	  things (or anything else we notice in the source) with #### Kst2
	  to remember to remove them. As for the file format, maybe we
	  should bump a version number of the file format in Kst2 so we can
	  move compatibility parsing out of the main Kst reader

2004-12-16 19:13  staikos

	* : remove all QCursor::pos() except ones related to keyboard and
	  context menu events. Should give a major speedup on paints (not
	  draws), and mouse move

2004-12-16 19:10  arwalker

	* : Maintain forwards and backwards compatibility for the square
	  setting for exported plots.

2004-12-16 02:07  arwalker

	* : Allow the user more options when exporting to a graphics file.
	  Printing is next.

2004-12-16 00:31  staikos

	* : - add lots of timers to help diagnose the slowness - point out a
	  major slowness factor (~10%-35% depending on scenario) in
	  kst2dplot - remove unused virtual function in metaplot There is
	  still some undiagnosed slowness

2004-12-16 00:04  staikos

	* : does this help with the label bug?

2004-12-15 22:27  staikos

	* : - compile - includemoc - ignore

2004-12-15 22:22  staikos

	* : add testlabelparser

2004-12-15 20:06  staikos

	* : revert formatting changes - extra nesting makes the code more
	  difficult to read and is no more or less functional. empty comment
	  lines in the middle of functions just means less fits in the
	  screen, and again help nothing.

2004-12-15 19:52  arwalker

	* : Use a smarter algorithm to do the re-gridding which moves plots
	  to the grid based on the closest plot relative to their top-left
	  corner. CCMAIL: 95029-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-15 19:01  netterfield

	* : On loading from a kst file we were getting three re-draws of the
	  plots: 1) empty plots - really fast and makes loading seem more
	  friendly 2) an explicit re-draw in KstDoc::newDocument 3) a third
	  one triggered (I think) by the update system (it is after we exit
	  KstDoc::newDocument and is delayed if update timer is set really
	  long. #2 didn't seem to show, and doesn't seem to accomplish
	  anything, since #3 happens anyway. #2 doesn't work anyway, because
	  it doesn't appear to deal correctly with axis allignment (it works
	  plot by plot, and not on the whole tlv, so if a redraw is not
	  required, it is by luck.) But I could be wrong here. This patch
	  gets rid of #2, and does not appear to have any negative side side
	  effects, but speeds things up in loading a long plot.

2004-12-15 17:15  staikos

	* : timer fixlets

2004-12-15 16:52  staikos

	* : a couple new testcases that pass

2004-12-15 16:51  staikos

	* : more finegrained, demonstrates that lock contention is 0-1 ms
	  max.

2004-12-15 16:34  staikos

	* : - move the label timer to the right place to avoid a crash - add
	  finer grained curve plot timer (more to come)

2004-12-15 15:06  netterfield

	* : Add some kdDebug benchmark info on how long (wall clock) various
	  drawing things take. To deactivate, remove #define PLOTBENCH in
	  kst2dplot.cpp Some notes from the bus ride home: -for ~100000 or
	  more points, curve drawing completely dominates. -labels (labels +
	  axis) are #2 -Every other curve draw is ~70% longer. Why???
	  -loading from the command line draws once. Loading the exact same
	  thing from a .kst file draws 3 times, the second time very slowly.

2004-12-15 07:22  staikos

	* : parse scalars and strings out

2004-12-15 06:53  staikos

	* : all testcases pass

2004-12-15 06:49  staikos

	* : complete redesign of the label parser, now it passes all the
	  testcases except one minor one, and it seems to be completely
	  LaTeX compatible in the parts that are implemented. Now we just
	  need to implement the scalar section (easy), and the renderer.

2004-12-14 22:00  staikos

	* : redesign the way ^, _ and {} work in the parser to be more
	  robust. Fixes some parse errors, but not all. testcases presently
	  crash

2004-12-14 21:40  arwalker

	* : Part of previous bug fix.

2004-12-14 20:39  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to mark a curve as not participating in automatic
	  axes range calculations. CCMAIL: 95124-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-14 20:30  staikos

	* : More failing testcases

2004-12-14 20:24  staikos

	* : testcase that passes

2004-12-14 20:21  staikos

	* : add parser support for \n and \t - fixes 3/8 broken testcases

2004-12-14 20:05  staikos

	* : label parser fixlets and a testcase to show many bugs in the new
	  parser

2004-12-14 19:32  staikos

	* : rather important - make the signatures match

2004-12-14 19:12  staikos

	* : - make the linked list doubly linked - remove the parser from
	  kstviewlabel, which will no-longer compile.

2004-12-14 18:50  arwalker

	* : Use more meaningful variable names. Indent correctly. Remove
	  obsolete check.

2004-12-14 16:11  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT make perl script happy

2004-12-14 16:02  staikos

	* : disable view labels and extract the label parser. work on this
	  is continuing, but this part is stable.

2004-12-14 15:37  netterfield

	* : BUG: Fix drawing bug for other line types.... Fill the poly-line
	  before drawing it to preserve line type. If Ymin==Ymax in a pixel,
	  only insert 1 point into the poly line.

2004-12-14 14:41  staikos

	* : make forced updates happen immediately This is as close as we'll
	  get to fixing 95025 without fixing 95117 I think. It still pauses
	  after the dialog closes, but this is because it's doing an update
	  before it repaints. BUG: 95025

2004-12-14 05:17  netterfield

	* : BUG: When opening a filter dialog, the default values were not
	  being loaded into the scalar selectors. This fixes that.

2004-12-14 05:16  netterfield

	* : BUG: 95020 when more than one data point lies in a pixel, a
	  vertical line is drawn in that pixel, from the min to max point in
	  the pixel. If ymin==ymax, then the line is of zero length. With
	  linewidth!=0, a 0 length line draws nothing. Hence, no line. This
	  adds linewidth to the length of the vertical line - so something
	  always gets drawn.

2004-12-13 23:06  arwalker

	* : Correctly setup the clip region for printing.

2004-12-13 21:15  arwalker

	* : Make bars honour line width and line type. Make points honour
	  line width.

2004-12-13 20:21  arwalker

	* : Update the line when the bars are toggled.

2004-12-13 19:27  arwalker

	* : Check that the desiganted vector name is not already in use, and
	  if it is then try a new name. The previous approach was too
	  simplistic as it assumed that the vector name was never already in
	  use.

2004-12-13 18:35  arwalker

	* : Honour the line width and color correctly. Don't use the
	  requested line width for bar graphs.

2004-12-13 07:56  staikos

	* : make the geometry of the label closer to correct

2004-12-13 07:40  staikos

	* : add a partially functional tab implementation, and fix many bugs
	  with label rendering. These are mostly regressions and are very
	  major. Still many lurk. For instance, these don't render properly:
	  \sum 2^a^b^c^d foo\tau\tbar x^100 They did render properly last
	  year. Time to drop Kst labels and go with the new rendering
	  engine?

2004-12-13 03:37  staikos

	* : fix enable-disabled state (wrong menu was called), and always
	  show the menu entries instead of dynamically removing them. it's
	  confusing to remove them randomly.

2004-12-13 02:44  staikos

	* : call update on menu events again. this keeps dialogs in sync,
	  but is much more efficient: kst: Dialogs updated in 442ms kst:
	  Dialogs updated in 25ms kst: Dialogs updated in 321ms kst: Dialogs
	  updated in 0ms

2004-12-13 01:23  arwalker

	* : Reset line style after use. Remove unused variable. CCMAIL:

2004-12-11 06:41  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2004-12-11 03:49  netterfield

	* : 1) Fix a bug in clipping: GetPlotRegion returns the plot region
	  relative to the widget, for mouse position use... use Lx, Hx,
	  instead, so that curves in all windows get plotted, not just in
	  the first window. 2) get rid of "emit modified" from from key
	  press and mouse release events: If the user loaded from the
	  command line, zoomed around, then exited, there is no need to
	  prompt for saving....

2004-12-11 03:48  netterfield

	* : OPTIMIZE: don't update dialogs on contect menu events. Only
	  delete plot and remove curve can benefit from it, and they call
	  update directly.

2004-12-11 03:44  netterfield

	* : Put in debugging statements to look for unnecessary
	  updateDialogs. They are rather slow... Some will be killed in the
	  next commit, but some remain.

2004-12-11 03:14  staikos

	* : - remove duplicated signal/slot connections - move #includes
	  into the .ui - simplify code - bFoo->foo, iFoo->foo as per coding
	  guidelines

2004-12-11 02:34  staikos

	* : no captions - they get in the way for translators

2004-12-11 01:32  arwalker

	* : Use clip regions to keep symbols within the plot.

2004-12-11 01:13  arwalker

	* : Scale symbol size with line width, so we don't lose the symbols
	  when the line width is increased.

2004-12-11 00:44  arwalker

	* : Added ability to define the density of points used to identify a
	  line. Disable and enable not only the edit fields, but also the
	  labels associated with items in the curve appearance widget.
	  CCMAIL: 86501-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-10 14:50  netterfield

	* : This program attempts to benchmark the qt/X calls used by kst,
	  to see if your graphics card is a bottleneck to performance. To
	  make it, qmake -project qmake make Typical kst screen updates are
	  1-5 Hz, so anything over 20Hz is fine. The xorg or XFree drivers
	  are ~20% faster in this bench than the ATI binaries. I have not
	  checked NVIDIA's drivers. You can expect ATI 9600: ~30 Hz NVidia
	  G4 ~35 Hz ATI 9800: ~50 Hz ATI 8500: ~30 Hz S3 on board: 2-6 Hz
	  Laptop Radeons: 12 Hz - 25 Hz, depending on model and driver. As
	  with all benchmarks, make sure nothing else is running. In some
	  cases I have found terrible performance, even though nothing else
	  was running. Restarting the X server fixed it. Not sure why....

2004-12-10 07:55  arwalker

	* : Make the axes alignment work for printing and export as well as
	  on-screen. CCMAIL: 93593-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-10 02:30  netterfield

	* : BUG: 94232 Make tick intervals special for hours, minutes, and
	  seconds....

2004-12-09 22:20  arwalker

	* : Better calculate the tick positions. Previously
	  RelPlotRegion.width()/height() was used to determine the scale.
	  This is incorrect as if the height is, for example, 100 then we
	  want to scale by one less than this. If we draw to rows 0 and 100
	  then this will actually exceed the RelPlotRegion by one pixel, as
	  RelPlotRegion is confined from pixels 0 to 99.

2004-12-09 20:30  arwalker

	* : Fix problem with zero point offset. CCMAIL:
	  93548-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-12-09 20:15  netterfield

	* : Fix histogram test failure: -Now the top limit of the top bin is
	  inclusive, which means that if autobin is used, all data points
	  end up in a bin. The bottoms of all bins are inclusive (as before)
	  and the tops of all bins other than the top are non-inclusive.
	  -Remove ::point() which was left over from when histograms were
	  curves.

2004-12-09 20:11  netterfield

	* : -Fix some errors in the histogram tests -don't use depricated
	  (and now removed) histogram->point() method There are two tests
	  which fail, as I expect them to. I don't know why they should
	  pass. I have indicated this with comments. George?

2004-12-09 19:21  arwalker

	  entry in the future, thanks. BUG: 94720

2004-12-08 21:20  staikos

	* : Possibly found a cause of Kst not cleaning up properly on exit.
	  I think the delay loops became infinite in some cases (race), and
	  so the update thread would never exit, and then KstApp gives up,
	  kills the thread, and this triggers a race with KstDoc. I'd be
	  interested to know if this crashes or causes invalid memory access
	  on RedHat 9 still.

2004-12-08 07:32  staikos

	* : - detabify source - remove unnecessary paints from dialogs -
	  make sure dialogs are updated on wasModified()

2004-12-08 06:18  staikos

	* : remove unnecessary updates, especially in the GUI thread. Fixes
	  issue in 1.0 where dialogs would freeze after OK for a short

2004-12-08 06:01  staikos

2004-12-06 02:56  staikos

	* : fix memory leaks discovered with the regression test (very
	  tricky, but in most cases just limited to the error paths)

2004-12-05 23:51  staikos

	* : fix a big pile of histogram bugs (memory errors, inconsistent
	  internal state, etc) pointed out by the regression tests. Actually
	  the same number of tests still fail...

2004-12-05 22:39  staikos

	* : more enable final fixes, still 2 more to go

2004-12-01 23:12  staikos

2004-12-01 17:21  staikos

	* : indirect files no longer have to end in .cur, adjust ascii to

	* : fix a couple regressions in the regression suite runner :)

2004-11-30 01:43  staikos

2004-11-25 05:55  staikos

	* : loads more testcases, and all now pass with specific error

2004-11-25 04:51  staikos

	* : more error cases

2004-11-25 04:07  staikos

	* : Added loads more equation tests, and some infrastructure to
	  better diagnose problems with equations. Most tests focus on parse
	  errors as opposed to proper equations, and especially force errors
	  in more cases than before. The parser now returns details on what
	  specifically is wrong with the equation. Three testcases still
	  only give generic errors (that's considered a failure according to
	  the test driver), and there are probably many more untested cases.

2004-11-25 01:20  staikos

	* : Added a parse error handler. Needs error case text in the parser
	  to be even somewhat meaningful I think, but no more spewing to the

2004-11-24 23:05  staikos

2004-11-03 15:38  netterfield

	* : BUG: As pointing out a while ago by Andrew, a change I made to
	  allow empty *Labels to take up no room if they are empty also
	  changed the way labels are handled in terms of what the correct
	  justification should be. Since, up to now, the Justification of
	  these otherwise fixed labels is stored in data file, this change
	  meant that old files (August and earlier) request the wrong
	  justification for the labels. This patch does 2 things to the way
	  that [X|Y|Tick]*Labels are handled. 1) it assumes that the
	  position of these labels is fixed, and overwrites whatever
	  justification might have been in the file. 2) it assumes that
	  since neither the position nor the justification for these labels
	  is going to be listened to, it shouldn't write them to the file.
	  It means that kst files written by new versions of kst will not
	  work on old ksts, but old kst files will work on new ksts.

2004-11-01 05:04  staikos

	* : 1) add plugin error codes as mentioned on the list 2) after a
	  very long, thorough debugging session, discover the reasons for
	  messed up plot layouts and zooming on my laptop. It was a
	  combination of: a) gcc 2.95/ppc bug which seems to be solved by
	  using this->foo() instead of foo(), along with specifying the
	  default argument explicitly b) bug in the cleanup() algorithm 3)
	  add lots of asserts to try to narrow these things down faster in
	  the future

2004-10-31 23:03  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-10-31 23:00  staikos

	* : add configuration support to the data wizard too. also point out
	  some inefficiencies

2004-10-31 22:34  staikos

	* : add datasource configuration support to the vector dialog, and
	  an example with the ascii source. data wizard still needs to earn
	  this button. There is a bit of a logic problem remaining with
	  this. It's conceivable that the user needs to configure the data
	  source before he can read his file, but the configuration can't be
	  accessed until a data source is found that can read the file. I
	  think we need to add datasource configuration elsewhere also. This
	  is a pre-1.0 issue.

2004-10-31 21:14  staikos

	* : data source type is displayed in the wizard

2004-10-31 20:31  staikos

	* : Another binary incompatible change: pass through to the user if
	  the field list is complete or not.

2004-10-31 20:20  staikos

	* : binary incompatible change for datasources - field list function
	  now returns what it thinks the file is along with its list of

	* : this should enable all but display of the data source config

2004-10-29 03:52  staikos

	* : - fix the KURLRequesters to complete in the proper location - on
	  second thought, don't store the full path to files from the wizard
	  because we don't want them to end up absolute in the .kst file. In
	  the future we can have both features by storing the working
	  directory separately in vector defaults and concatenating it with
	  the relative file if it's different on next launch.

2004-10-29 03:27  staikos

	* : store files in the history as absolute paths so that launching
	  Kst from other directories still allows the user to find his file
	  from the history. Also use KURL for URL parsing. This stuff really
	  should be fixed in kdelibs I think.

2004-10-29 02:57  staikos

	* : FINALLY fix this really annoying bug: data wizard url requester
	  needs to take the current working directory into account! More to
	  follow.

	* : use KGlobal::staticQString for static QStrings. Meant to do this
	  a long time ago.

2004-10-26 02:07  staikos

	* : - port the fit and filter dialogs to support strings - remove
	  unchecked dynamic casts (static cast was fine there anyway) -
	  change a couple of return(x); to return x; while I see them

2004-10-26 01:41  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-10-26 01:40  staikos

	* : - Add string support to Kst, with support for using them from
	  plugins, as requested by IAS. They work just like other parameters
	  except they are optional right now. Docs will follow. - Add
	  widgets for creating and selecting strings, but nothing beyond
	  that yet because I'm not sure what the proper interfaces will be.
	  Strings can be embedded in labels (they share the vector/scalar
	  namespace), but they don't appear in any dialog lists yet. - Fit
	  and filter dialogs need updates to deal with this. They will
	  probably assert() if the asserts are still in the code. -
	  Equations can't deal with plugins that use strings - Some DCOP
	  interfaces were added to view and edit strings

2004-10-25 21:38  netterfield

	* : Get rid of unwanted printf

	* : Display the origin of a marker in the Plot dialog... Marker tab.
	  A marker value will be followed by one of: 1) "" - indicates a

	  automatically generated value on a falling edge CCMAIL:

2004-10-25 18:55  arwalker

	* : Only create data markers for rising edges where the y-value goes
	  from 0 to some +ve vale. Only create data markers for falling
	  edges where the y-value goes from sonme +ve value to 0. Previously
	  this was also done for -ve values, which was confusing; as a

	* : Switch the position of the top and x-axis sample label so that
	  the sample labels are read in the same order (left to right, top
	  to bottom) as the labels are edited (top to bottom).

2004-10-05 00:32  arwalker

	* : Fix problems with the absolute values displayed on the x-axis
	  and y-axis. Originally if the range of the x-axis or y-axis became
	  too small to display the axis values in a reasonable amount of
	  space an absolute value would be displayed to the right or above
	  (for the y and x-axis respecitively) the axis label, with delta
	  values on the axes themselves. A subsequent modification reduced
	  the usefulness of this, by putting the label and absolute value at
	  the same position, but with the label centred and the absolute
	  value left justified. However, this was only helpful when the two
	  did not overlap (which was seldom for anything but a single plot
	  in a large window). These changes now use the former method when
	  the two would otherwise overlap, and the latter when there is
	  sufficient room to display them on the same line. At the same time
	  it fixes some problems introduced by the first change when the
	  font sizes for the label and asolute value were not the same.

	* : Does this solve the update issues? If so, are there any
	  conceivable cases where we would still want to be able to force an
	  update of data sources? CCMAIL: 89844@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-24 06:15  staikos

	* : Implemented monochrome printing option. It's "good enough" for
	  now, but a more general solution for switching to monochrome would
	  be a good idea someday. CCMAIL: 90125-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-24 03:45  staikos

	* : - make curve width for printing configurable (it allows a delta,
	  so you can shift the width of all curves up or down by as many as
	  20 pixels) - cleanup headers, pack bits - remove enum entries for
	  PSD curves and equation curves and #if 0 the related code (do we
	  need a new solution for this? see Kst2DPlot) - enhance our view
	  object templates more to help with some of the above (and note
	  that it triggered a gcc crash when not written as it currently is)

2004-09-24 02:35  staikos

	* : disable date printing here too

2004-09-23 20:28  staikos

	* : Kst print settings page CCMAIL: 90115@bugs.kde.org,
	  90124@bugs.kde.org, 90125@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-23 19:35  staikos

	* : skeleton for the print options page so that it doesn't get lost

2004-09-23 16:44  staikos

	* : piolib seems to need this now

2004-09-23 16:26  staikos

	* : fix geometry for printing after removing text

2004-09-23 16:01  staikos

	* : Disable printing of page/date/etc. Will re-add later in an
	  optional manner. CCMAIL: 90115@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-23 15:51  staikos

	* : typo :)

2004-09-23 15:49  staikos

	* : - minor cleanups, comments added - convert static_cast to
	  kst_cast. static_cast is more messy and perhaps less correct
	  (could cause crashes even).

2004-09-23 14:27  netterfield

	* : Fix for [Bug 90098] New: New PSD has wrong freq vector CCMAIL:
	  90098-done

2004-09-22 23:32  arwalker

	* : This should make the PSD curve the same color as the data curve.
	  It also make the PSD point style the same as the data point style
	  (if applicable). I think this now closes 83943, with Bath's
	  earlier fix. CCMAIL: 83943-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-22 19:55  staikos

	* : Add a search/select line to the change file dialog and fix the
	  tab order CCMAIL: 89574-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-22 19:43  staikos

	* : wrong modeline in here.

2004-09-22 19:12  netterfield

	* : Fix bug in 'minPosX': Autoscaled Log X mode now ignores the 0
	  bin... Also fix bug in highest frequency bin of psd.

2004-09-22 15:26  netterfield

	* : Check boxes for log-log, log-linear, etc psds from data wizard
	  partial fix for 83943 Also fix X-axis assignment in psd curves
	  plotted from data wizard. Log X mode does not work well now,
	  because f goes to 0... log(0) is -inf... This needs a workaround.
	  CCMAIL: 83943@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-22 15:09  staikos

	* : workaround for Marc-Antoine

2004-09-22 12:46  mueller

	* : fix compile

2004-09-22 12:06  mueller

	* : unbreak compile

2004-09-22 11:43  staikos

	* : oops

2004-09-22 04:56  staikos

	* : Add the ability to select vectors in the change data file dialog
	  by the file that produces them. CCMAIL: 89186-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-22 04:02  staikos

	* : aha, I see what I did wrong. :)

2004-09-21 20:46  staikos

	* : - filters and fits should be updated when their outputs are
	  updated - Play should do "read to end" not "count from end"
	  CCMAIL: 89718-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-21 19:53  staikos

	* : - for regular updates, slave vectors update their producers (not
	  fully implemented, but done for PSD slaves, equation slaves, and
	  plugin slaves) - use kst_cast

2004-09-21 17:26  staikos

	* : introduce kst_cast<>. Example: KstEquationPtr e = ....;
	  KstDataObjectPtr p = kst_cast<KstDataObject>(e);

2004-09-21 16:23  staikos

	* : fix indenting and remove unneeded typedef - happy recompile!

2004-09-21 16:19  staikos

	* : unused

2004-09-21 16:12  staikos

	* : Only save data sources that are in use in the Kst file CCMAIL:
	  89889-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-21 15:42  staikos

	* : save orphan state for scalars

2004-09-20 23:18  staikos

	* : please

2004-09-20 23:10  staikos

	* : remove dead code

2004-09-20 20:52  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-09-20 20:51  staikos

	* : - split equationcurves into equations and curves, psds into psds
	  and curves -> old Kst files no longer fully load properly, but it
	  warns when this will happen -> new node names in kst files for
	  equations and psds - plugins have a <pid/> scalar that can be used
	  as input to give the main Kst process ID

2004-09-20 19:54  staikos

	* : noticed this, no time to investigate right now

2004-09-15 17:30  arwalker

	* : Handle resize() failures. Fix i18n problems. Prevent potential
	  crash by delaying initial update.

2004-09-15 16:59  arwalker

	* : Correctly load the ELOG settings into an event monitor entry.

2004-09-14 18:02  arwalker

	* : Display only a single error message for all the invalid vector
	  sources. CCMAIL: 89498-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-14 17:46  arwalker

	* : Ensure old ticklabel settings are updated properly. Remove
	  obsolete code. CCMAIL: 89437-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-13 19:37  staikos

	* : allow indirect sources to hang around while what they point to
	  isn't around, but refresh pick it up later. This does not address
	  the issue of opening an indirect file that doesn't exist on disk.
	  I'm not sure this is worth the effort since it really doesn't make
	  much sense. I consider that part of the report "WONTFIX". CCMAIL:
	  88425-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-13 19:22  staikos

	* : Implement more operators and add them to the list: && - logical
	  and & - becomes bitwise and || - logical or | - becomes bitwise or
	  != == and = are equivalent ';' added everywhere in the parser to
	  make it compile with my bison again repaired debugging output
	  CCMAIL: 88950-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-13 18:55  staikos

	* : Let's see how unportable this is. Keep our own fork of
	  QWaitCondition around. CCMAIL: 88084-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-12 14:38  mlaurent

	* : QString(i18n(...)) -> i18n()

2004-09-10 19:02  arwalker

	* : Forgot to check this in as part of earlier focus problem fix.

2004-09-10 18:45  arwalker

	* : Add the grid line settings to the Kst Settings dialog. CCMAIL:
	  89180-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-10 17:46  arwalker

	* : Make the default grid color halfway between theplot foreground
	  and background colors. CCMAIL: 89180@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-10 16:55  arwalker

	* : Make double-click functional. CCMAIL: 89183-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-09 18:50  staikos

	* : fix license here too

2004-09-09 18:47  staikos

	* : fix license

2004-09-09 18:46  staikos

	* : PSD class that is not a curve - probably not very functional yet

2004-09-09 18:35  staikos

	* : add a most likely non-functional kstequation which is a data
	  object but not a curve

2004-09-09 15:46  staikos

	* : slightly modified patch to fix solaris build CCMAIL:
	  89179-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-09 01:57  staikos

	* : - remove unused variables - fix indent (detabify, =) - remove
	  redundant if()s

2004-09-09 01:41  staikos

	* : unnecessary

2004-09-09 01:07  staikos

	* : CDF datasource updates from Nicolas Brisset

2004-09-08 22:52  arwalker

	* : Fix a problem with the focus indicator in the tie box, when
	  groups are present. Previously if a group was in a plot then when
	  the mouse was moved over the group the focus indicator would not
	  be reset on the plot that the mouse was last in.

2004-09-08 22:39  arwalker

	* : Implement the major tick spacing as proposed by Barth. I think
	  we should now close 86505, as it is addressing so many issues that
	  is largely useless. If there are any remaining problems that
	  someone feels were previously covered by this and are not yet
	  addressed then please report a new (specific) bug. CCMAIL:
	  86505-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-08 20:04  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings.

2004-09-08 17:07  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings.

2004-09-08 06:06  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-09-08 06:06  staikos

	* : add comments, remove unused members, and make the slots work
	  (Q_OBJECT required)

2004-09-08 02:59  staikos

	* : cleanup, especially make it clear what the parameter is

2004-09-07 17:16  staikos

	* : const cleanup, remove unneeded indirection, use KProgress, not
	  QProgressBar

2004-09-07 17:15  staikos

	* : can't i18n this - it breaks language changes

2004-09-04 02:17  arwalker

	* : Make sure we can cancel creation of a new window.

2004-09-03 20:08  arwalker

	* : Remember the auto-tick value for the y-axis hysteresis.

2004-09-03 19:15  arwalker

	* : Small optimisation.

2004-09-03 17:48  arwalker

	* : Ensure that _stLast is set correctly.

2004-09-03 17:16  arwalker

	* : Provide some hysteresis in the tick seperation. This is designed
	  only to solve the problem of the y-axis tick spacing jumping in
	  value following a small change in the max-min difference of the
	  curve. For other scenarios, where the difference change is more
	  extreme, a fixed scale should be set by the user. CCMAIL:
	  88337-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-09-01 22:04  arwalker

	* : Further ensure that we update the PSD of a plugin output vector
	  if the data file was changed on any of the input vectors. This was
	  previously not happening, unless the new vector happened to be
	  significantly longer than the old vector.

2004-09-01 21:39  arwalker

	* : If we have changed data files then make sure we recalculate any
	  PSDs. If the number of samples if equal to the number of new
	  samples then its safe to assume that the data file was changed,
	  and so we recalculate the PSD. Previously this was not happening
	  and so the PSD would remain the PSD of the old vector data.

2004-09-01 20:46  arwalker

	* : This fixes (partially) a problem reported by MAMD. A PSD is only
	  relcalculated if the number of new points is >= the current PSD
	  length / 16. For plugin output vectors this new length was always
	  zero, so the PSD would never be recalculated. This has now been
	  fixed, but the PSD will still not be recalculated unless the
	  condition described above is satisfied.

2004-09-01 20:44  arwalker

	* : Preceed some member variables by _.

2004-09-01 20:44  arwalker

	* : Only fill in the fit parameters if the fit was made
	  successfully.

2004-09-01 16:34  arwalker

	* : Add ability to apply color settinsg to multiple plots.
	  Consolidate some duplicated code.

2004-08-31 21:20  arwalker

	* : Add option to apply axes settings to all plots in window or all
	  plots. CCMAIL: 88515-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-31 21:02  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warning.

2004-08-31 20:05  arwalker

	* : Make more consistent in positioning of UI elements.

2004-08-31 20:04  arwalker

	* : Ensure that the plot dialog is upated when the user modifies a
	  plot setting through a mouse operation. Previously if the user
	  zoomed in with the mouse and the plot dialog was open to the plot
	  being worked upon then the plot dialog would not update with the
	  new axes settings. CCMAIL: 87001-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-31 20:01  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warning.

2004-08-31 18:47  arwalker

	* : Add an option to set the gridline color to default (which is the
	  plot foreground color). This is useful when the plot color is
	  changed in automatically changing the gridline colors.

2004-08-31 18:46  arwalker

	* : Don't display the Creating PSDs... status message if none are
	  being created.

2004-08-31 17:15  arwalker

	* : Explicitly designate the format as 'G' for the curve and image
	  values displayed in the status bar.

2004-08-30 20:58  arwalker

	* : Cleanup.

2004-08-30 20:55  arwalker

	* : Add ability to rename an existing window, from the
	  Window->Rename... menu item. CCMAIL: 88351-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-30 19:24  arwalker

	* : This occurs as the data manager may be requested to
	  updateContents( ... ) before update( ... ). If this happens then a
	  crash may result if any object's name in the data manager had been
	  changed in the meantime. If the object name (part of the
	  KstObjectItem) can not be found then the code assert's (and so
	  crashes). The solution is not to assert, but instead check that
	  the object corresponding to the name was found. CCMAIL:
	  88357-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-27 21:28  rchern

	* : Make readybar bigger to show messages

2004-08-27 21:11  rchern

	* : Move progress label to left side of progress bar, and shrink it.
	  Also reduce size of progress bar.

2004-08-27 20:57  rchern

	* : Check for object instead of its name

2004-08-27 20:42  rchern

	* : When right-click->remove from Plot or right-click->add To Plot
	  in data manager, repaint the plot

2004-08-27 20:03  arwalker

	* : Allow for the PSDs in determining the number of steps for the
	  progress bar.

2004-08-27 19:32  arwalker

	* : Make the progress bar and progress messages functional again.
	  Hiding and showing the progress bar and message does not work as
	  the function to show them posts a message, which does not get
	  handled until the message queue is pumped, which may not be until
	  the data wizard has finished creating and populating all the
	  plots.

2004-08-27 19:01  netterfield

	* : Change the defaults to something possibly more useful The
	  bandpass limits were not being used correctly: fixes this.

2004-08-27 18:16  rchern

	* : Book Title Style Capitalization

2004-08-27 18:13  rchern

	* : Styleguide?

2004-08-27 17:38  arwalker

	* : Ensure that a plot that is deleted from the right-click context
	  menu is propery destroyed.

2004-08-27 16:45  arwalker

	* : Fixed reported usage count problems.

2004-08-27 16:42  arwalker

	* : Removed unused function. Fixed compile problem under gcc-3.4

2004-08-26 23:36  rchern

	* : Make sure variable is initialized if there happen to be no
	  recent files.

2004-08-26 23:17  rchern

	* : QListBox::currentItem() seems to return a non -1 value even if
	  no item is selected, for some reason.

2004-08-26 22:18  rchern

	* : Move databar to the left and maximize it, so it doesn't keep on
	  resizing, and the curve/image name doens't keep on moving. Also
	  "Ready" makes more sense next to "360MB Available" I will change
	  it back if this is less desireable...

2004-08-26 21:34  rchern

	* : Change caption to indicate that files are Kst session files, not
	  data files. Choosing a data file for the data wizard is still one
	  click away (clicking the Data Wizard... button) CCMAIL:
	  87465-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-26 21:27  rchern

	* : When maximized, turn onGrid off, and return to previous onGrid
	  state when unmaximized. Save the previous onGrid state if
	  maximized. CCMAIL: 88168-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-26 21:15  arwalker

	* : Avoids conflict between not_close_xpm defined here and in
	  kdockwidget.cpp.

2004-08-26 20:28  rchern

	* : If opening a file is not successful, don't add it to the recent
	  files list.

2004-08-26 20:22  rchern

	* : Don't show error message twice when file not found

2004-08-26 18:40  arwalker

	* : Follow style guide

2004-08-26 18:03  rchern

	* : Clean up the quickstart dialog and implement its remaining
	  functionality. CCMAIL: 87465@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-26 17:42  arwalker

	* : Make scalar list more consistent between label tab in plot
	  dialog and label dialog. Make application of font and angle
	  settings more comprehensible. CCMAIL: 87086-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-26 16:56  arwalker

	* : Modified contact information

2004-08-26 16:53  arwalker

	* : Simplify the code for plotting of non-solid line types.

2004-08-26 16:42  netterfield

	* : Insert Andrew and Rick in authors list. Contact info has been
	  left blank. If you want to add it, do so. (In main.cpp)

2004-08-26 16:17  arwalker

	* : Add automatically generated scalar gicing last read value of a
	  vector. CCMAIL: 88120-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-26 03:00  netterfield

	* : Jeff Klien found a critical real time bug (race condition) in
	  which a plot repaint could (and would) happen after the X vector
	  had been but before the Y vector had been updated, leading to an
	  inconsistent plot. This fixes this, by (and at the cost of) not
	  letting the update thread do any processing until the UI thread is
	  finished painting. This does not influence the responsiveness of
	  the UI, and has little or no performance penalty for a single CPU
	  sustem, but does slow things down on the multi-cpu system. There
	  are few, if any, other options, however.

2004-08-26 00:28  rchern

	* : Make the QuickStart dialog optional

2004-08-25 23:18  arwalker

	* : Moved everything to bug tracker.

2004-08-25 23:07  arwalker

	* : Check that a color is not already in use in a plot, and if it is
	  use the least used color in the plot.

2004-08-25 21:48  rchern

	* : First draft of quickstart dialog. Does not work properly yet
	  (but sort of works).

2004-08-25 19:09  rchern

	* : When creating a new window name, try not to suggest an existing
	  one (this can happen when a new window is created after loading a
	  .kst file).

2004-08-25 18:44  arwalker

	* : On the off chance that no color can be found in the palette that
	  is far enough away from badColor, makesure that we don't get stuck
	  in an infinite loop.

2004-08-25 18:20  rchern

	* : Prompt on window close. This can be turned off via KstSettings

2004-08-25 17:48  arwalker

	* : Plot the axes after the curves, so that the tickmarks are not
	  covered by any curve. CCMAIL: 87988-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-25 17:35  arwalker

	* : Differentiate between calls to setXRange and setLXRange, and
	  check the arnge accordingly. In the interim a workaround is to set
	  the desired range in non-log mode, and then switch to log mode.
	  CCMAIL: 87915-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-25 17:00  netterfield

	* : .Empty plot dialog uses the default font, by default. -Data
	  Wizard uses i18n("<Auto Name>") rather than "W?" to refer to auto
	  name, to be consistent with all other <Auto Name> situations. -The
	  "Enter a name for the new window" pupup default prompts to "<Auto
	  Name>".

2004-08-25 16:26  arwalker

	* : Refer only to a zero phase Butterworth. Changed various names
	  and descriptions. CCMAIL: 87446-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-24 23:34  rchern

	* : Make Save As behaviour more like other applications - add .kst
	  if not included in filename - if file already exists, keep on
	  opening Save As dialog until save is successful or it is cancelled

2004-08-24 23:20  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolete code.

2004-08-24 23:02  arwalker

	* : Fixed bug.

2004-08-24 22:58  arwalker

	* : Fixed the following from the RELEASE_PLAN document: Line Types
	  don't work for curves with high point density. Need a distance
	  traveled base algorithm

2004-08-24 22:55  arwalker

	* : Might as well do this correctly just in case we ever decide to
	  display axis labels on the right hand of the plot.

2004-08-24 22:21  rchern

	* : When setting the window caption, also set the tagName of the
	  topLevelView CCMAIL: 87978-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-24 21:22  netterfield

	* : Some changes to the way that offset axis number mode works: move
	  the offset to the left in the same line as the label +[0] instead
	  of [0] comments welcome.

2004-08-24 21:03  rchern

	* : Accelerator key for checkbox

2004-08-24 21:02  rchern

	* : Save the <columns> tag as part of the window, not the plot
	  CCMAIL: 87972-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-24 19:18  rchern

	* : Fill in the field values before disabling them for real-time

	* : Better alignment.

2004-08-24 00:10  rchern

	* : Tried to sort of implement custom major ticks, but there are
	  problems with number labelling on the x axis with densities other
	  than 5, especially in log mode. Rotating the numbers by 45 degrees
	  helps though

2004-08-23 21:37  arwalker

	* : Remove obsolete code.

2004-08-23 21:32  arwalker

	* : Provides better axis alignment by ensuring x-axes align for

2004-08-23 19:55  rchern

	* : Enable Auto mode for minor ticks. Used as the default for all

	  completely) in log mode if they are too close together

2004-08-23 17:32  rchern

	* : Fix y minor ticks in log mode.

2004-08-23 16:04  netterfield

	* : -add variables to allow manual or auto minor ticks. -Change auto
	  minor tick algorithm to use 4 for 2E? major ticks (so we count by
	  0.5E? rather than 0.4E?). Still use 5 for 1E? and 5E?.
	  -temporarily disable manual minor ticks so we can test the new
	  auto-mode. If we like it, the next step is to add a 'auto' check
	  box to override the manual minor tick entry.

2004-08-21 20:10  rchern

2004-08-21 00:06  rchern

	* : Use custom minor ticks in log mode, but currently only when
	  major ticks are a power of 10 apart, like before.

2004-08-20 20:47  rchern

	* : Custom minor ticks. Does not work in log mode yet.

2004-08-20 17:21  rchern

	* : Make sure grid lines don't overlap axes ticks

2004-08-20 00:46  rchern

	* : Grid lines for plots are now an option. The lines are drawn
	  using 1 pixel width, and dotted style. The colours for major and
	  minor grid lines can be specified separately (i.e. gray for major
	  lines, and light gray for minor lines). CCMAIL: 86505@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-19 23:22  rchern

	* : UI for plot grid lines. Part of bug 86505

2004-08-19 21:02  rchern

	* : 86582 emulated in tied zoom mode. Discussion?

2004-08-19 20:55  rchern

	* : Plot marker jumping behaviour in tied zoom mode has been
	  changed. Main differences: - jumping to a marker will cause all
	  other tied plots to center on the same x value. The x zoom level
	  is not changed, consistent with scrolling behaviour - if a tied
	  plot (that is not the active plot) is in log mode, it will not
	  jump at all if asked to jump to a non-positive center, but all
	  other tied plots will try to jump (if they can) - if the active
	  plot is unable to jump (no marker available, or negative plot
	  marker in xLog mode) then other tied plots will not jump either,
	  even if they are able to. The last two points make it possible to
	  have unsynchronized jumps when in tied zoom mode. This should be
	  like "sharing" plot markers (the markers themselves are not
	  shared, however). CCMAIL: 86582-done@bugs.kde.org

	  dirfile reader has completely different fields... CCMAIL:
	  86918-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-11 16:59  rchern

	* : checkParameters unlocks the vector always upon return, and new_i
	  and edit_i relock it after.

2004-08-11 13:50  netterfield

	* : Default scalar value is 0, since it is unlilkely you wanted the
	  speed of light.

2004-08-11 00:31  rchern

	* : Markers refer to data objects instead of curves now

2004-08-10 23:52  rchern

	* : -No need to rename "Curve Placement" anymore for image dialog
	  -clean up button group names

2004-08-10 23:35  arwalker

	* : Fix 86939

2004-08-10 20:39  staikos

	* : remove unneeded includes. Please test with KDE 3.1 to be sure I
	  didn't break the build with older KDE versions

2004-08-10 20:34  rchern

	* : readlock() changes from last commit - not sure why I did not
	  upload this last time.

2004-08-10 20:00  netterfield

	* : Attempt to fix color selection stuff. Colors are more different,
	  and a better attempt at avoiding background colors has been
	  implemented. CCMAIL: 85353-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-09 23:08  arwalker

	* : Fix for 86869

2004-08-09 21:25  arwalker

	* : If we are in datamode and the mouse leaves and re-enters a plot
	  at the same position, ensure that the same nearest data point is
	  highlighted when the mouse re-enters.

2004-08-09 20:58  arwalker

	* : Don't display meaningless 0's in the status bar when Kst is
	  started.

2004-08-09 20:55  arwalker

	* : Added ability to display rotated labels on the x-axis and
	  y-axis. This feature is not accessible through the UI interface,
	  so can not be used. If the feature is considered desirable the UI
	  can be simply added.

2004-08-09 20:54  staikos

	* : dead code

2004-08-09 20:03  staikos

	* : when you pile up your variables at the top of the method, they
	  lose context and eventually end up like these - instantiated but
	  never used, just wasting mallocs and frees in our tight update
	  loop also note an expensive operation we do here

2004-08-09 19:23  rchern

	* : Update for window curvePlacement widget in image dialog, and
	  readUnlock KST::dataObjectList before KstDataManagerI::update()
	  tries to writeLock it

2004-08-09 18:09  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to specify the color for an arbitrary label. The
	  default is to use the plot foreground color, as before.

2004-08-09 17:57  rchern

	* : Move checking of arraydialog parameters into separate function,
	  remove compiler warnings.

2004-08-09 17:13  rchern

	* : Remember last point for contour plots instead of recalculating

2004-08-09 16:40  rchern

	* : Some i18n comments

2004-08-09 04:19  staikos

	* : some cleanup, and set a timer to update the RAM stats more often

2004-08-09 03:49  staikos

	* : display the approximate amount of usable memory that we will
	  restrict the user to in the statusbar

2004-08-09 03:04  staikos

	* : - Try to prevent users from loading too much data from the data
	  wizard - Rework the conditional compile of sysinfo/psversion - fix
	  clean compilations

2004-08-09 01:52  staikos

	* : fixincludes

2004-08-08 02:13  staikos

	* : Added another unused virtual method to determine if the object
	  is valid or not. The idea is that when an object has an internal
	  issue (failed large malloc, loss of data file, etc), it should be
	  able to get marked as "bad", visible in the data manager, and then
	  purge could [optionally?] remove the bad objects recursively. Our
	  own sanity checks will still probably go into the data wizard for
	  now.

2004-08-08 00:33  staikos

	* : cleanup dead code, fix rather random indenting, eliminate a
	  QMessageBox in favour of KMessageBox

2004-08-08 00:12  staikos

	* : review and address a few more FIXMEs, and add an efficient way
	  for a datasource to reset(), currently implemented by no-one, but
	  supported by KstRVector.

2004-08-07 15:37  staikos

	* : spec file update from Matthew Truch

2004-08-06 23:17  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-08-06 22:56  rchern

	* : Move drawing of images back up before axes.

2004-08-06 22:39  arwalker

	* : Broke up draw(...) into several helper functions. Rick, could
	  you check your last commit to this file and make any necessary
	  changes again. Thanks, Andrew

2004-08-06 20:23  rchern

	* : Plot images before axis tick marks

2004-08-06 19:52  arwalker

	* : Compiler warnings. Use DBL_EPSILON in place of stl.

2004-08-06 19:39  rchern

	* : Make colormaps and contour maps work in log axis mode.

2004-08-06 17:57  staikos

	* : fitlabel is unused now

2004-08-06 17:52  staikos

	* : all the items on my list merged in (histograms exporting vectors
	  is implicit in making histograms non-curves)

2004-08-06 17:34  staikos

	* : restore 2-space indenting, add some comments and spacing, inline
	  logX and logY, and remove duplicate header

2004-08-06 16:38  arwalker

	* : Same as previous.

2004-08-06 16:37  arwalker

	* : Significant changes to labels. Labels are now displayed to the
	  correct number of significant digits, using an absolute value and
	  delta if necessary. The status bar plot position also gives the
	  values to the correct numbre of significant digits. Everything
	  should be working for both normal and log modes.

2004-08-06 04:21  staikos

	* : only use _var for members - otherwise it's confusing

2004-08-06 04:15  staikos

	* : another incorrect i18n

2004-08-06 04:13  staikos

	* : eliminate false warning on commit

2004-08-06 03:59  staikos

	* : A complete audit of all the dialogs except data manager and data
	  wizard, which should have already been auditted (and I have
	  checked them in the recent past). - most importantly, all locking
	  should be fixed - inefficiencies removed - warnings removed -
	  formatting fixed - dead code removed - unused variables removed -
	  some unnecessary headers removed (many more lurking) - many i18n
	  fixes Please test thoroughly. This was a huge task and fully
	  testing it just isn't a simple procedure. Also KstImageDialog had
	  merge conflicts which I merged manually. Rick, you might want to
	  review those changes to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

2004-08-06 01:18  rchern

	* : Data mode shows Z value of topmost image in status bar.

2004-08-05 23:55  rchern

	* : Handle cases of 3 and 4 intersections for contour plotting

2004-08-05 22:24  rchern

	* : Initialize image edit dialog properly.

2004-08-05 21:41  rchern

	* : Draft of contour maps for images. New/edit dialogs work,
	  saving/loading images with contours work, and plotting sort of
	  works. Also moved plotting of images out of Kst2DPlot::draw

2004-08-05 21:12  staikos

	* : Fix the ugly, ugly, ugly locking bug discovered by Barth. It
	  goes like this: DataObject contains maps, and locking data object
	  locks all objects inside its maps. set*Vector() methods in
	  KstEquationCurve remove an item from the map and add a new one.
	  the old one gets deleted (in the best case -- in the worst case it
	  doesn't and we have a permanently locked object) and then the new
	  one is inserted - unlocked. Therefore when we unlock() the
	  dataobject, it tries to unlock the new vector, which isn't locked.
	  This fix hacks around the problem, but we need a real solution
	  because this can get really messy really quickly.

2004-08-05 20:02  staikos

	* : dead code removal, and reparse the equation immediately in
	  setEquation() so we can update isValid()

2004-08-05 18:30  staikos

	* : remove dead code, eliminate a fixme

2004-08-05 18:18  staikos

	* : add a new static helper to KstDataSource: fieldListForSource()
	  If this is implemented in the datasource plugin, it will give us a
	  short-path to getting the field list for autocompletion. it
	  remains to be seen if this will make other sources inefficient,
	  but it should help with some anyway.

2004-08-05 17:48  staikos

	* : remove the Plot Position spinbox. I tried to implement it again
	  but it really doesn't make much sense anymore since: 1) it refers
	  to 2d space and we have 3d space now (z-order) 2) we have multiple
	  windows 3) we have free layout capabilities 4) implementing it
	  requires all kinds of tricky geometry work now 5) most of the time
	  it has to be disabled because it's not applicable CCMAIL:
	  86504-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-05 16:58  staikos

	* : cleanup - remove dead code, add support for loading the old
	  "plotcols" tag, and store _columns when we're using it.

2004-08-05 16:31  staikos

	* : some minor plotgroup fixes, and make it visible that a plotgroup
	  has the focus or is selected. Previously the selection and focus
	  rects were not distinguisable from the border in many cases, and
	  this will become more of a problem when we make the border color
	  configurable. A good solution for now is to hide the border as it
	  becomes very clear that something has 'happened' and the focus or
	  selection rects are also very clear at that point. CCMAIL:
	  86520-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-08-05 16:00  staikos

	* : amazing, I finally got rid of the rediculous automake warnings.
	  :)

2004-08-05 14:51  staikos

	* : spec patch from Matthew Truch

2004-08-04 22:49  rchern

	* : Plot labels for images

2004-08-04 21:24  staikos

	* : i18n("%1") is not really useful for translation since it's
	  basically "%1", at least in these cases.

2004-08-04 21:17  arwalker

	* : In the drawing function keep everything in double precision as
	  long as possible. If this is not done then zooming in to a very
	  small region in x, relative to the seperation in points, causes no
	  line to be drawn when it should be. This results from double
	  values getting incorrectly cast to integer values as the double
	  value is too large in absolute value to be represented by an
	  integer.

2004-08-04 21:09  staikos

	* : these have to be kept in sync

2004-08-04 19:54  arwalker

	* : Be more explicit in the desired tick label precision. Split
	  TickLabel into XTickLabel and YTickLabel as at some point we may
	  want to allow tick label rotation or staggering.

2004-08-04 19:40  staikos

	* : plot stacking algorithm implemented

2004-08-04 17:57  rchern

	* : Rainbow spectrum palette from blue to red

2004-08-04 17:57  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-08-04 17:31  staikos

	* : - remove unneeded .desktop files - fix typos in configure.in.in
	  for CDF

2004-08-04 17:22  rchern

	* : Bug 86588

2004-08-04 16:57  rchern

	* : Make Autoscale, Auto Up, and Spike insensitive Autoscale work
	  with images

2004-08-04 16:33  staikos

	* : layout mode should mark the document dirty

2004-08-04 02:36  arwalker

	* : Fix for 86524.

2004-08-03 23:10  rchern

	* : User interface for contour plots - does not work yet. (Part of
	  images, not really a new feature)

2004-08-03 20:05  arwalker

	* : Fix problems with labels (86118). If the text, size, etc.
	  associated with a label was modified then the width would be
	  explicitly recalculated, else it would be recalculated on every
	  draw operation. With the axes labels the cached Width property of
	  the label would not be set as invalid (-1) so the old Width would
	  be assumed to be valid, which was not true following a resize
	  operation on a plot. We now explicitly invalidate the old label
	  Width.

2004-08-03 20:00  arwalker

	* : Removed references to creation of new filters.

2004-08-03 18:31  rchern

	* : Don't let multiple markers to be created by holding down Insert
	  and moving cursor

2004-08-03 18:28  coolo

	* : don't be silly

2004-08-03 18:14  rchern

	* : Use Insert to insert a plot marker at current cursor position

2004-08-03 17:41  rchern

	* : Add/remove images from plots using data manager, add i18n to
	  imagedialog captions

2004-08-03 17:36  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-08-03 17:35  staikos

	* : another plugin

2004-08-03 17:16  staikos

	* : update from Nicolas

2004-08-03 17:13  rchern

	* : Change curve to image and make sure at least one radio button is
	  selected

2004-08-03 17:03  staikos

	* : compile fixes (removed references to filterlists), fixed cdf
	  makefile

2004-08-03 16:49  staikos

	* : I don't see GSL in here

2004-08-03 16:06  arwalker

	* : Add ability to create new Array and Image from the Data menu.

2004-08-03 15:47  arwalker

	* : Added shortcut for Array... button.

2004-08-03 10:30  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typos.

2004-08-03 07:04  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-08-03 04:03  staikos

	* : enable compilation of the CDF plugin

2004-08-02 21:39  staikos

	* : some minor cleanups, merge CDF changes, minor optimizations, and
	  fix border drawing to draw overtop of contents. borders still
	  flicker a bit in layout mode

2004-08-02 20:03  netterfield

	* : More label and automatic name stuff...

2004-08-02 13:58  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-08-01 04:17  netterfield

	* : -Add KST::suggest[Curve, PSD, Histogram]Name -Use them where
	  appropriate. All default name generators have been taken out of
	  kstdatacollection and put in kstdefaultnames.

2004-08-01 03:05  netterfield

	* : -Minor fixes to labels from fits -Start at re-working automatic
	  tagnames for data objects in an attempt to avoid such monstocities
	  as 'F1-P2-C2-V3-T_BL_SSHIELD' -Added
	  KST::suggestCurveName(vectorname): strips the V?- from vectorname.

2004-07-31 03:34  netterfield

	* : A cross spectrum plugin.

2004-07-30 22:49  rchern

	* : Different icon from vector icon for new array button

2004-07-30 22:33  rchern

	* : Resize the image dialog better.

2004-07-30 22:27  rchern

	* : Use curve placement widget for new image dialog. I am not sure
	  why it does not resize properly though.

2004-07-30 20:59  rchern

	* : Show images in popup menu

2004-07-30 19:39  rchern

	* : Allow multiple images

2004-07-29 22:51  rchern

	* : Align buttons

2004-07-29 22:37  rchern

	* : Autogenerate markers from curves. Notes: - Curves will add
	  markers, but will not remove existing ones, even when changing
	  from one curve to another as source, or if points are altered in
	  an existing curve. - Manually removed markers that were created by
	  curves will be readded at the next update (if the curve is still
	  used for auto-generation) - Only changes in y values of data
	  points from 0 to non-zero, or non-zero to 0 are detected. Changes
	  from negative to positive for example will not be detected (is
	  this correct behaviour?)

2004-07-29 22:30  arwalker

	* : With the fix for 86116 as implemented we see nothing of the blue
	  group border (except when it flickers) and only see the focus rect
	  in the region where it intersects the plot regions. We now see the
	  blue group border everywhere it doesn't intersect the plot regions
	  and see the focus rect in its enirety.

2004-07-29 21:46  arwalker

	* : Added filter menu. I have not put the dialog in a widget as yet,
	  but this is simple to do.

2004-07-29 18:48  arwalker

	* : Implementation of the simpler fits class design. Known problems:
	  When deleting a curve the corresponding label will not be deleted.
	  After deleting the label there is no simple way to re-create it.
	  Modifying the name of one of the fits parameters will not be
	  reflected in the label.

2004-07-29 18:05  rchern

	* : Saving/loading of images, remove background colour from images,
	  calculate colours more correctly

2004-07-29 01:45  staikos

	* : fix the memory leak

2004-07-29 01:39  staikos

	* : enhanced debug output to illustrate the problem

2004-07-29 01:32  staikos

	* : remove debug :) CVS_SILENT

2004-07-29 01:26  staikos

	* : fix some memory leaks, add index, make sure that index is
	  compared .lower()

2004-07-29 01:04  staikos

	* : credit where due

2004-07-29 00:31  staikos

	* : some cleanups and comments, and make it work with the new
	  datasource class

2004-07-28 23:54  staikos

	* : the CDF datasource - won't work right now, will fix shortly

2004-07-28 22:43  staikos

	* : piolib bug

2004-07-28 22:32  staikos

	* : datasources now take an optional parameter for frameCount()
	  indicating the field. This helps sanify the planck plugin, which
	  appears to work now. CCMAIL: Laurent.Guglielmi@cdf.in2p3.fr,
	  claude mercier <claude.mercier@ias.u-psud.fr>

2004-07-28 21:59  staikos

	* : clarify rvector a bit before I dig into frameCount() changes
	  here

2004-07-28 21:46  staikos

	* : implement a new datasource function: isEmpty() This is more
	  explicit than frameCount() < 1 and it has the added bonus of
	  allowing us more flexibility with frameCount()

2004-07-28 21:12  staikos

	* : another unimplemented feature - the plugin can say if the field
	  list is complete or not

2004-07-28 20:20  staikos

	* : add in support for a pointer to a config widget, to be embedded
	  in the vector dialog and data wizard. Presently unused, but needed
	  for binary compatibility reasons post-1.0.

2004-07-28 18:12  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-07-28 18:08  staikos

	* : plot groups are citizens too

2004-07-28 18:01  staikos

	* : - plot groups need to fully paint themselves - background colour
	  should be loaded by viewobject base class CCMAIL:
	  86116-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-28 17:46  staikos

	* : styleguide fixes. There is one hack in here that is technically
	  a styleguide violation but the user can't really tell. Will fix
	  later. CCMAIL: 86112-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-28 17:19  staikos

	* : implement data source priorities understands_ now returns an
	  int, defined to be 0..100 as a "percentage match" CCMAIL:
	  68074-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-28 15:46  netterfield

	* : Cast

2004-07-28 15:39  netterfield

	* : Dragging of multi-line text now works. -There are DnD problems
	  with rotated text (seems like a previous bug) -Line spacing takes
	  no account of super and sub scripts (wontfix) Since this is just a
	  hack until viewlabels are implemented, I'm not inclined to do much
	  more on it.

2004-07-28 14:07  netterfield

	* : Start at new lines in labels. - '\n' in a label adds a new line
	  - Greek replacement hapens first, so in 'the \nuser' \nu will be
	  interpreted as as the greek letter nu. - a space after a \n will
	  be ignored, so in 'the \n user' '\n ' will be a new line, not a
	  new line followed by a space. As this point, static endering of
	  the multi line label seems to work, but rendering of the label
	  during dragging seems messed up.

2004-07-28 06:53  staikos

	* : Notes on how to do i18n for the Kst team

2004-07-28 05:32  staikos

	  painting

2004-07-28 04:46  staikos

	* : - remove File->New because it's confusing. Maybe we'll add an
	  alternative later - cleanup kstdebug.cpp (getXXX -> xxx), remove
	  unnecessary QString copies - return const& instead of pointer to
	  member - note about internationalization problem - remove unused
	  rc entry

2004-07-28 04:40  staikos

	* : fix uninitialized variable reference

2004-07-28 02:25  staikos

	* : install the new palette

2004-07-28 02:12  staikos

	* : - remove kst3dplot from the build since it does nothing - add
	  some comments and fixmes - casts shouldn't contain variables -
	  shortcircuit evaluation for if() if() {}

2004-07-28 01:10  rchern

	* : A grayscale palette for use by images.

2004-07-28 01:05  rchern

	* : Make dialogs functional for both New and Edit, make

2004-07-27 17:20  rchern

	* : Saving and loading of arrays. Also arrays now use vectors
	  instead of a copy of vector elements, and decrease or (optionally)
	  increase their x dimension if the vector length changes.

2004-07-27 17:05  netterfield

	* : Fix for Bug 85211: kst consumes 100% cpu when plotting data with
	  missing secondary files A field with a bad or missing linterp file
	  now silently returns zero. This patch also allows kst to read
	  dirfiles with the first (or more) raw channels missing.

2004-07-27 06:40  staikos

	* : I think this works for the data dialog base class. Now to test
	  it with one of the dialogs.

2004-07-27 00:56  netterfield

	* : Fix for Bug#: 85706 printed plots are hard to see Minimum line
	  width is width/999.

2004-07-27 00:30  netterfield

	* : Fix for bug 85828: Wasted space

2004-07-27 00:08  arwalker

	* : I'm guessing that a check for the datamode is quicker than the
	  check for a mutex.

2004-07-26 23:52  arwalker

	* : Fix for 85822.

2004-07-26 22:21  staikos

	* : added data dialog base class - not done yet

2004-07-26 22:19  arwalker

	* : With the advent of Linux being able to function as a memory
	  manager and not just an address space manager this kind of memory
	  check is no longer pointless. George, I'd appreciate if you'd
	  leave these kind of checks alone - which I believe is the decision
	  that we arrived with Barth some time ago.

2004-07-26 22:12  staikos

	* : the usual

2004-07-26 21:52  staikos

	* : - not sure why these minimum sizes were in eqdialog.ui, but I
	  think they're wrong - add size hints for custom widgets

2004-07-26 21:44  staikos

	* : images of our designer widgets

2004-07-26 21:32  rchern

	* : Missed some files

2004-07-26 21:29  rchern

	* : Use arrayselector widget and rough implementation of editing for

2004-07-26 20:06  staikos

	* : 3.2.0 is sufficient for our MDI check

2004-07-26 20:00  arwalker

	* : Prevent the number of points per frame from being set to 0.

2004-07-26 19:51  netterfield

	* : Fit dialog modified. Editing didn't work before, and still
	  doesn't. We need to decide how it is going to work.

2004-07-26 18:09  arwalker

	* : Prevent the user from zooming in too much, which ends up with an
	  axis' labels all displaying the same value. The user is now
	  limited to zooming in to range of 0.000001 on both the x and y
	  axes. This can be modified by changing the values of
	  X_MIN_DIFFERENCE and Y_MIN_DIFFERENCE in kst2dplot.cpp. Set these
	  values to 0.0 to revert to the previous behaviour.

2004-07-26 16:48  arwalker

	* : Ensure an image prints correctly.

2004-07-26 00:19  staikos

	* : usage counts were not correct for data vectors

2004-07-26 00:12  staikos

	* : - remove unused methods - fix #85821 and #85733 - the same bug -
	  it was an assertion failure, and this is the one place where
	  KstApp::inst() can be null, in (app) destruction. I'm not sure
	  it's a good idea to be calling update methods from a destructor
	  though. CCMAIL: 85821-done@bugs.kde.org, 85733-done@bugs.kde.org

	  CCMAIL: 83942-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-24 16:36  staikos

	* : setModified on a few more cases. We will just have to fix these
	  one at a time as we come across them. The fix is easy:
	  KstApp::inst()->document()->setModified(); also some minor cleanup
	  (remove obsolete optimization) CCMAIL: 85354-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-24 05:40  staikos

2004-07-24 05:21  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-07-24 05:21  staikos

	* : our dependencies are getting more broken

2004-07-24 05:12  staikos

	* : - remove PSD update timer setting CCMAIL:
	  85406-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-24 05:09  staikos

	* : - static methods don't get the class listed in the interface -
	  remove warning

2004-07-24 04:54  staikos

	* : big pile of missing consts, and a tool to fix #85214

2004-07-24 04:44  arwalker

	* : Add filter to data manager.

2004-07-24 04:27  staikos

	* : indirect plugin requires the ability to return null from the
	  factory, so it needs to be handled CCMAIL: 85593-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-24 04:21  staikos

	* : remove warnings - one of those cases gcc 2.95 doesn't get right,
	  at least

2004-07-24 04:11  staikos

	* : Roadmap for Kst releases and dependency updates

2004-07-24 04:05  arwalker

	* : Right you are...

2004-07-24 03:37  staikos

	* : - keep headers in alphabetical order to avoid dupes (had many of
	  them in the past) and make it easy to spot ones that should be
	  removed - initialize pointer to 0 to avoid crash - remove possible
	  memory leak - make "image" private in kst2dplot - let's try to
	  slowly clean up these public member variables

2004-07-24 03:05  staikos

	* : - fixes according to ../devel-docs/codingstyle.txt (please read)
	  - use .isEmpty(), don't compare to a null/empty string - change to
	  a bitfield - warning removed - header reorganization

2004-07-24 02:49  staikos

	* : pointless

2004-07-24 02:46  staikos

	* : not portable

2004-07-24 01:18  rchern

	* : Let KstImage handle the color palette and mapping. (Dialogs are
	  still ugly).

2004-07-24 00:54  arwalker

	* : Minor enhancements

2004-07-23 20:41  rchern

	* : Calculate the z value more correctly

2004-07-23 20:25  arwalker

	* : Correctly position setPixRect()

2004-07-23 19:38  rchern

	* : Position the image properly

2004-07-23 19:11  arwalker

	* : Fix for 85731

2004-07-23 17:46  rchern

	* : Some test framework for kstarrays and images. Most of it is not
	  complete yet, including the dialogs and plotting.

2004-07-23 01:28  arwalker

	* : Draft of filters. At this point any comment about the UI design
	  (filterdialog.ui and filtersetdialog.ui) should be made. The code
	  is not yet functional but it should be clear where it is headed.

2004-07-22 23:32  staikos

	* : We need a better solution for this CCMAIL:
	  85701-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-22 19:53  staikos

	* : Implement modulo CCMAIL: 85701-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-21 22:15  arwalker

	* : Added ability to mofify fit labels properties.

2004-07-21 21:41  netterfield

	* : some more locking. Couple questionable points...

2004-07-21 19:27  arwalker

	* : Plot the legend if it is not sent to front.

2004-07-21 18:55  arwalker

	* : Correctly draw the x and y-errors when in log mode.

2004-07-21 18:40  staikos

	* : use 8bit pixmap and make the pixmap size in the back buffer
	  configurable

2004-07-21 18:03  arwalker

	* : When determining the number of points we need to plot for a
	  curve use XMin,XMax rather _x_min,_x_max to request the nearest
	  point in x for monotonically increasing x vector. _x_min,_x_max
	  are the log of the desired values.

2004-07-21 17:58  staikos

	* : Apply patch to install more files. CCMAIL: matt@truch.net

2004-07-21 06:11  staikos

2004-07-20 18:36  arwalker

	* : More efficiencies.

2004-07-20 18:00  arwalker

	* : Keep the x-errors and y-errors within the plot. Determine the
	  x-axis ticks and y-axis ticks more efficiently.

2004-07-20 17:28  staikos

	* : oops :)

2004-07-20 16:48  arwalker

	* : Finished fits parameters.

2004-07-20 15:55  staikos

	* : I just realised what fixing this implies - basically it will
	  flicker like mad and be unreadable or unusable. I think we're
	  doing the best that can be done at this point.

2004-07-20 14:39  staikos

	* : lots of minor cleanups, including removing one clever gem of
	  mine: (effectively) if (foo || !foo) { if (foo) { } }

2004-07-20 14:07  staikos

	* : fix shift+click drawing the focus rect if the mouse moves

2004-07-20 05:53  staikos

	* : 1) drag and drop for the listboxes in the plot dialog, execute()
	  is disabled note: shift+click is not supported, only control+click
	  or click 2) fixes according to ../devel-docs/codingstyle.txt 3)
	  use operator==() and !=, not compare() - it's much more clear 4)
	  use QString::null, not "" 5) add document about memory issues in
	  Kst and C++, including policy for dealing with failed allocations
	  6) remove dead code 7) add an assert() on KstApp::inst() since the
	  check for null is constantly being readded. If you trigger it,
	  please send me the backtrace.

2004-07-20 02:44  staikos

	* : Does this help with pixmap pressure on the problematic machine?

2004-07-19 21:57  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT was done by Andrew

2004-07-19 21:56  staikos

2004-07-17 20:49  staikos

	* : - get rid of unused variables/objects - delay object

	  failure - conform more to ../devel-docs/codingstyle.txt (please
	  read) - fix #85358 CCMAIL: 85358-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-17 20:20  staikos

	* : - correct KstSharedPtr usage - delay object construction until
	  needed, if needed - use const QString& - get rid of forceRedraw
	  since it was only used for a case that should never be forced
	  anyway (no response to email about other uses)

2004-07-17 20:18  staikos

	* : results of more testing

2004-07-17 02:45  netterfield

	* : More locking.

2004-07-17 01:00  rchern

	* : Let Kst2DPlot register doc changes. Using Alt+Button to create
	  plot marker marks document as modified, and updates plot marker
	  list in plot dialog.

2004-07-17 00:04  rchern

	* : Add some Whats This balloons to the Marker tab

2004-07-16 22:48  netterfield

	* : Some race removal in curve and vector dialogs. Should be
	  reviewed.

2004-07-16 22:44  rchern

	* : Use KMessageBox instead of QMessageBox. Also change the dialog
	  from Info type to Sorry type. Also make sure the duplicate plot
	  name warning does not go underneath the plot dialog, because it
	  can be hard to find if it does.

2004-07-16 21:49  rchern

	* : Don't display trailing zeros in plot marker list

2004-07-16 21:09  rchern

	* : Avoid duplicate markers

2004-07-16 21:09  arwalker

	* : Add the parameter names for a fit from the Parameters vector. At
	  present this is not generic. If there is a rationale for the
	  generic case then it can be simply added. The only problem would
	  be pulling out the parameter names for more than one vector. The
	  best solution would probably be add to another name to the
	  parameterName( ... ) method giving the desired vector index or
	  vector name.

2004-07-16 20:37  arwalker

	* : Didn't mean to check in the setClipping(...) line. I introduced
	  to track down the performance problem with printing and never
	  removed it.

2004-07-16 19:06  staikos

	* : microoptimizations for functions that get called with high

2004-07-16 18:59  rchern

2004-07-15 23:03  rchern

	* : Enable the Remove button properly

2004-07-15 22:37  rchern

	* : Plot markers sort of work now. Can use Alt+Left/Right (or scroll
	  menu items) to jump from marker to marker. Disabled when there are
	  no plot markers in the desired jump direction. Can use plot dialog
	  to remove markers. Alt+Left click still creates plot marker.

2004-07-15 21:28  staikos

	* : remove extra reference count on the top level view. one still
	  lurks.

2004-07-15 21:13  staikos

	* : don't clear the children, it's supposed to happen shortly later,

2004-07-15 20:41  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT note to self

2004-07-15 20:37  staikos

	* : Temporarily uglify the data wizard to remove the memory errors
	  it's causing. I could not track down the reason why so far, but it
	  might be a Qt bug. Have we decided to not use the file dialog
	  embedding? If so, we could easily fix all of this by doing it all
	  in designer again. also: - delay object creation - remove
	  redundant tests - don't instantiate two painters with the same
	  name in the same function when we only need one anyway - fix
	  memory leaks

2004-07-15 20:14  arwalker

	* : First shot at adding 'frameNum' scalar for data sources: -Binary
	  compatibility is maintained: I used *d. Do we want to bother since

	  uncovered a ... bug: data sources get created by browsing with the

	* : Keep plot marker list sorted and add some empty functions for
	  scrolling to marks

2004-07-15 01:17  arwalker

	* : This removes additional redraws that would happen every time a
	  plot was printed or exported. The technique now is to modify all
	  the values of _geom more carefully, so that before and after the
	  print/export operation they are guarenteed to be the same, which
	  gets rid of the need for a redraw. The only problem encountered
	  was with kst2dPlot::xInternalAlignment() which would reduce the
	  size of the back-buffer every time a repaint is done. During
	  printing this would cause the buffer to shrink in size, and so not
	  all of the plot would be subsequently redrawn following the print.
	  I addressed this by not calling xInternalAlignment() during a
	  print or export operation.

2004-07-14 22:59  rchern

	* : Attempt to implement some of plot markers. Using Alt+click to

2004-07-13 23:12  arwalker

	* : Framework for display the parameter names of a fit. At present
	  these names will not get translated as they reside in the plugin,
	  which does not have access to Qt. The parameter names are acquired
	  through a function (rather than e.g. putting them in the xml) as
	  some of the fits have a variable number of parameters, which
	  depend on some input scalar. Thus, the parameter names must be
	  calculated dynamically.

2004-07-13 22:54  arwalker

2004-07-13 18:20  staikos

	* : - check return code on large malloc/reallocs note: needs

	  dialogs, through KstViewWindow

2004-07-12 22:55  arwalker

	* : Make datamode work for plots that are not situtated at the top
	  left of a window.

	* : Update the non-linear fits so that parameter and covariance
	  results are marked as non-vector.

2004-07-12 21:25  arwalker

	* : Mark appropriate output entries as non-vector.

2004-07-12 21:18  arwalker

	* : Don't do some of the usual vector thing with parameter and
	  covariance results from a fit.

2004-07-12 21:09  staikos

	* : missing one

2004-07-12 20:48  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-07-12 20:35  staikos

	* : - remove missing files - delay QString construction. This can be
	  called very often, and even gcc with -O9 can't figure out that it
	  can delay this call.

2004-07-12 20:11  arwalker

	* : Fix the previous fix so that we can view the fits results.

2004-07-12 20:03  rchern

	* : Use pressed slot instead of clicked slot for QListView of field
	  selection.

2004-07-12 19:53  staikos

2004-07-12 19:38  staikos

	* : open for 0.99

2004-07-12 18:40  netterfield

	  that "obsolete and unsupported versions of FITSIO should only be
	  used in exceptional cases where the latest CFITSIO release cannot
	  be used."
	  (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio_prev_release.html)

2004-07-12 17:17  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-07-12 17:16  staikos

	* : release notes for each release go in here

2004-07-12 16:51  arwalker

	* : Moving of plots by drag-and-drop is not yet supported, so the UI
	  has been modified to reflect this. Use the context menu Move To
	  instead for this functionality.

2004-07-12 00:49  arwalker

	* : Move the window capture to the main thread else we freeze.

2004-07-12 00:21  arwalker

	* : Don't use alloca(), it's asking for a world of (portability)
	  hurt.

2004-07-11 06:02  netterfield

	* : Work on columns... + Data dialogs can select to regrid select
	  number of columns + command line can work on grid - Dialogs don't
	  seem to pick up columns (bug) - Plot dialog can't set columns or
	  make new windows (not done yet) - rmb cleanup does not respect
	  columns (not done yet)

2004-07-10 15:58  netterfield

	* : Remove deadlock as suggested by gs.

2004-07-10 15:51  netterfield

	  this is not related to updates.

	* : Fix for bugs 83878 and 83879.

2004-07-10 06:06  staikos

	* : notes

2004-07-10 06:01  staikos

	* : no need to do this - updateContents() already has this check

2004-07-10 03:04  netterfield

	* : Fix for bug 84843: plugins don't update on new or edit.

2004-07-10 02:20  netterfield

	* : 3.2 -> 3.1

2004-07-10 01:45  netterfield

	* : Curve placement widget has a 3rd option (don't plot) Don't
	  updateContents on dataManager if it is not showing.

2004-07-09 22:06  staikos

	* : update data objects only when input vectors have changed. note:
	  we need to rethink updates yet again

2004-07-09 21:54  staikos

	* : update the data manager in realtime, efficiently note: usage
	  count is still really broken

2004-07-09 21:43  staikos

	* : some update fixes, but the data manager and/or dialogs still
	  lose some sync it seems

2004-07-09 21:09  staikos

	* : KstSharedPtr usage

2004-07-09 21:04  staikos

	* : fix open, cancel

	  update if the combo is open

2004-07-09 20:19  staikos

	* : - realtime updates for the vector dialog now work - update
	  dialogs on loading new Kst file CCMAIL: 84834-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-07-09 19:28  staikos

	* : can't reproduce it - must have been fixed already

2004-07-09 19:08  staikos

	* : note for later

2004-07-09 18:48  staikos

	* : hmm automake didn't like that

2004-07-09 18:08  rchern

	* : 3.1

2004-07-09 18:06  rchern

	* : Use datarangewidget for Change Data Ranges dialog

	* : More stuff

2004-07-09 17:49  netterfield

	* : Remove unused parameter

2004-07-09 17:42  netterfield

	* : event monitor dialog converted into new format. All are the same
	  now.

2004-07-09 16:07  netterfield

	* : Real time updating was not working, because the paint events
	  were not actually being processed before giving the 'all clear' to
	  the ui thread. This fixes that, and improves on the clarity of the
	  comments in the update thread.

2004-07-09 14:55  staikos

	* : disable temporarily

2004-07-09 06:13  scripty

2004-07-09 01:04  rchern

	* : Data object dialogs seem to resize between Edit/New dialogs
	  without overlapping widgets now. Also seem to resize properly with
	  huge font/button styles.

2004-07-08 22:31  staikos

	* : - remove duplicate signal - make the ascii plugin update
	  properly when the file is overwritten or erased and recreated

2004-07-08 21:40  staikos

	* : oops

2004-07-08 19:32  netterfield

	* : Ahem.... (fix too many redraws)

2004-07-08 19:29  staikos

	* : the neverending pit of dispair

2004-07-08 19:06  staikos

	* : notes :)

2004-07-08 18:43  rchern

	* : Alter some old DCOP functions so kst now passes test1.sh and
	  test_equations.sh completely.

2004-07-08 16:36  rchern

	* : 3.1

2004-07-08 16:32  netterfield

	* : -fix data range widget to set enables properly when vector
	  settings are changed. -re-arrange icons slightly. -Use standard
	  icon in a nearly standard way for making graphics exports

2004-07-08 00:34  netterfield

	* : Update plugin dialog to new format (like all the rest). This one
	  is pretty hairy! I suspect that there are serious locking issues
	  in here (I didn't change that stuff) so perhaps George can look at
	  edit_I and verify that there are or are not problems....

2004-07-07 23:54  arwalker

	* : Send the event emails on a seperate thread, instead of using
	  sendmail.

2004-07-07 22:17  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT my turf

2004-07-07 21:19  staikos

	* : fix a couple text strings

2004-07-07 21:09  staikos

	* : *really* don't use a groupbox

2004-07-07 21:06  staikos

	* : styleguide fixes

2004-07-07 20:58  staikos

	* : a little less confusing - sufficient for 0.98 anyway

2004-07-07 20:09  staikos

	* : I think we're ok on redraws now - testcases if we aren't

2004-07-07 19:56  staikos

	* : oh yeah, I fixed it :) CVS_SILENT

2004-07-07 19:54  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-07-07 19:53  staikos

	* : fix updating of dialogs verify that renaming of vectors now
	  works

2004-07-07 19:50  rchern

	* : Change comments

2004-07-07 19:42  staikos

	* : the usual

	* : - add the layout back :) - bug was fixed by barth

2004-07-07 19:35  staikos

2004-07-07 19:15  staikos

	* : more update fixes

2004-07-07 19:04  staikos

	* : appears to have been fixed

2004-07-07 19:03  staikos

	* : some updating fixes and lots of code cleanup and nomenclature
	  normalization

2004-07-07 18:18  staikos

	* : remove dead code, don't instantiate KPrinter when we don't need
	  to

2004-07-07 18:12  staikos

	* : if ::inst is null, we have much bigger problems on our hands
	  (for instance, "this" is null)

2004-07-07 18:06  staikos

	* : at least temporarily solution to eliminate the nested groupboxes

2004-07-07 17:43  staikos

	* : mouse wheel support for plots, minus Control button which I'm
	  not sure about yet.

2004-07-07 16:59  staikos

	* : fix spelling :)

2004-07-07 16:46  staikos

	* : note for future

2004-07-07 15:40  netterfield

	* : Some minor ui improvements aimed at reducing mouse clicks: curve
	  placement choice is now a radio box -you have to place a curve
	  -you can only place it in one place with this dialog but: there
	  are fewer mouse clicks in the common cases. You can chose to add a
	  curve to a plot even if there are no windows yet. If you do, a new
	  window with the default name (W1) will be made. If no vectors have
	  been made, vectordialog default prompt is INDEX.

2004-07-07 04:13  netterfield

	* : Data sources now report "INDEX" as one of the fields. (we need
	  to decide about internationalization of this) Eq dialog no longer
	  has groupbox within groupbox.

2004-07-07 00:30  staikos

	* : Only read back from the plugin if it was successful - any
	  regressions from this?

2004-07-06 23:07  arwalker

	* : Save the email sender with the event monitor entry.

2004-07-06 22:58  arwalker

	* : Make the saving of screen captures to ELOG functional again.
	  Remove compiler warnings. Add sender's email address for event
	  monitor.

2004-07-06 21:13  rchern

	* : Try to avoid curves with same colour as plot background

2004-07-06 19:27  arwalker

	* : Honour line type and width for histograms. Disable the point
	  style Type: label when applicable.

2004-07-06 18:58  arwalker

	* : Properly display the curve appearance widget.

2004-07-06 18:30  arwalker

	* : This modification seems to fix what appears to be a bug in
	  QSpinBox.

2004-07-06 18:03  rchern

	* : I think this it not needed anymore?

2004-07-06 17:49  rchern

	* : *** empty log message ***

2004-07-06 17:14  rchern

	* : - use KstViewObject::_backgroundColor and _foregroundColor to
	  store plot colours - use accessor/modifier functions already
	  existing

2004-07-06 10:08  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typos.

2004-07-06 04:35  staikos

2004-07-06 04:27  staikos

	* : notes about constness

2004-07-06 04:12  staikos

	* : compile

2004-07-06 03:55  staikos

	* : - a few misc bug fixes - increase precision of vector elements
	  in the vector table -> QTable is too slow for large vectors, we
	  need a new solution - fix a large number of styleguide violations

2004-07-06 03:46  netterfield

	* : 3.2 -> 3.1

2004-07-06 03:43  netterfield

	* : Histograms are updated now.

2004-07-06 02:39  netterfield

	* : Make psd averaging/no-averaging work, and set averaging to the
	  default.

2004-07-05 23:17  rchern

	* : Suggested (only) DCOP function for creating kstplugin objects -
	  cannot seem to use with DCOP command-line tool due to QStringList
	  parameter though.

2004-07-05 23:09  rchern

	* : Individual plot colours for each plot. Note: right now, if the
	  plot foreground or background colour happens to be the same as the
	  current default setting, then no foreground or background colour
	  is saved, respectively.

2004-07-05 22:26  netterfield

	* : Fix the eq dialog not working.

2004-07-05 16:19  rchern

	* : 3.1

2004-07-05 04:39  netterfield

	* : More reworking of dataobject dialogs. This time more serious!
	  vectors, curves, and psd's seem pretty good now (?) equations have
	  some layout and connection problems from designer. The others have
	  not been finished yet.

2004-07-04 10:28  adridg

	* : --enable-final fixes: * Static deleters get unique names *
	  static QStrings (which are evil evil evil, btw, certainly in
	  libraries but to be avoided elsewhere as well if possible) get
	  unique names

2004-07-04 10:26  adridg

	* : Warnings-- (note the i_label < 0 case is already dealt with)

2004-07-04 10:23  adridg

	* : 0/0 warnings-- by defining nan explicitly

2004-07-02 21:07  netterfield

	* : Graphics File Export now ~ works. There are still some aliasing
	  problems related to aspect rounding I think.

2004-07-02 19:36  netterfield

	* : Printing seems to work now.... But exporting to graphics is
	  probably broken...

2004-07-02 16:11  staikos

	* : more

2004-07-01 23:46  netterfield

	* : some more work on printing. not done yet.

2004-06-30 19:14  staikos

	* : document the design of Kst at the binary/application level, and
	  explain why it's done that way

2004-06-30 18:49  staikos

	* : add the mouse wheel event stubs and pass the events through.
	  will implement mouse wheel actions later as they need special care
	  for sensitivity

2004-06-30 18:37  staikos

	* : zoom pause implemented

2004-06-30 18:12  staikos

	* : eliminate more draw()s, make paints happen explicitly, not
	  implicitly, so that we can chain operations

2004-06-30 17:25  staikos

	* : implement the dirty flag, mark some items that I'm working on

2004-06-30 17:14  staikos

2004-06-30 17:12  staikos

	* : goodbye filters

2004-06-30 16:26  netterfield

	* : Printing and graphics file export now draws directly with the
	  painter rather than to the back buffer. This improves the
	  resolution of fonts, etc. Higher resolution for the curve
	  optimization still has to be done.

2004-06-30 15:57  staikos

	* : - remove redundant if(foo) { if(foo) {}} - refactor the release
	  plan to move optional items down - remove the frame field since it
	  no longer makes any sense - make copy work for non-data-mode too

2004-06-29 19:15  staikos

	* : Release plan for 0.98, targetting the end of next week

2004-06-29 18:25  staikos

	* : keeping us sane

2004-06-29 16:29  staikos

	* : gcc 2.95 seems to have template expansion problems. This works
	  around it. I am still encountering linking errors on libkst
	  though.

2004-06-28 23:33  staikos

	* : Eliminate KstViewObject::viewWidget() to make the code generic
	  again, refactor a bit more. Eliminate some double draws and double
	  paints. Next: eliminate more double draws/paints

2004-06-28 23:11  staikos

	* : more refactoring and _parent removal

2004-06-28 22:54  staikos

	* : Rename some functions to make it more clear what they do.

2004-06-28 21:03  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT dunno what this is, but it's unimplemented and unused

2004-06-28 20:59  staikos

	* : update documentation and start rerefactoring kst2dplot

2004-06-28 18:58  rchern

	* : readd header file

2004-06-28 17:25  arwalker

	* : Older versions of KDE do not have kdemacros.h If you need this
	  for newer versions of KDE then please do the appropriate ifdef's.

2004-06-28 02:03  staikos

	* : refactor

2004-06-28 01:58  staikos

	* : dead code removal

2004-06-28 01:48  staikos

	* : mark this stuff as deprecated, explain why

2004-06-28 01:29  staikos

	* : - fix KstSharedPtr usage again - make nomenclature consistent
	  (no-where in [modern] Kst code, or KDE or Qt libraries generally,
	  are getXXX() used, only setXXX() and XXX()) - remove dozens of
	  unneeded casts

2004-06-27 07:31  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-06-27 04:02  netterfield

	* : Change behavior for dataobject dialogs: New, Edit, and generic
	  are different cases. OK/Cancel used for New and Edit modes.
	  Behavior needs extensive testing now.... particularly plugins.

2004-06-26 22:43  mlaurent

	* : warning --

2004-06-25 23:36  arwalker

2004-06-25 21:58  arwalker

	* : Fixed 83941

2004-06-25 21:41  arwalker

	* : Seperate out updates for window creation and destruction from
	  other updates. In data mode correctly position the data marker,
	  which previously was off by several pixels at the edges of the
	  plot.

2004-06-25 20:25  netterfield

	* : remove debugging print statements...

2004-06-25 20:15  netterfield

	* : Resolve bug 84006

2004-06-25 19:54  arwalker

	* : Fixed several actual and potential crashes.

2004-06-25 19:51  netterfield

	* : The update thread can run much faster than the UI thread in many
	  real time cases. This fix causes the update thread to wait for the
	  UI thread to finish painting before submitting the next update
	  event.

2004-06-25 18:36  arwalker

	* : Fix build error.

2004-06-25 03:59  netterfield

	* : Fixed numerous unneeded (and painful) redraws. Added some
	  re-draw inhibiting optimizations. Re-did x axis alignment stuff
	  after failing to understand it well enough to debug it (it was
	  generating unneeded redraws).

2004-06-24 23:31  arwalker

	* : Add ellipsis where applicable.

2004-06-24 23:13  arwalker

	* : Make sure that we update the dialogs after a window is created
	  or destroyed.

	* : Makre sure we can function from the command line by creating a
	  default window if there isn't one.

2004-06-24 13:50  netterfield

	* : Added a dirfile maker for testing dirfiles and for testing real
	  time modes. It writes 5 frames/second, with some fields at 1
	  sample per frame, and some at 20 samples per frame.

2004-06-24 10:02  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typo (begining -> beginning).

	  window to another. This important as this cannot be achieved by
	  drag-and-drop when in MDI tab mode. Disabled filter functionality
	  until it is re-implemented.

	  the miniumum sizes for custom widgets more suitably.

2004-06-23 15:45  arwalker

	* : Don't need ellipsis on Match Axis... as no further user
	  interaction is necessary.

2004-06-23 01:09  arwalker

	* : No longer save the index value when a vector is saved to disk.
	  Decision made at UBC meeting by cbn, rc, and arw.

2004-06-23 01:00  arwalker

	* : Made FFT common widget fully functional. Note that at the moment
	  the "Interleaved average" checkbox applies only for the creation
	  of the PSD. If the number of data points in the vector greatly
	  increases (e.g. doubles) the interleaved average will be
	  subsequently created. If this were not the case performance would
	  be very negatively impacted. Please discuss.

2004-06-22 22:46  arwalker

	* : Use common widget for FFT options.

2004-06-22 20:52  arwalker

	* : Use common widget for data range.

2004-06-22 17:01  arwalker

	* : No longer create a default window. Results of discussion at UBC
	  between cbn, rc, and arw.

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-21 21:13  staikos

	* : most of samplesEnd is working

2004-06-21 20:53  staikos

	* : pausing works

2004-06-21 20:23  staikos

	* : enable realtime updates - pause/resume buttons still not fully
	  working, and I'm not sure if it was a bad build, but I was getting
	  crashes without -O0

2004-06-21 07:23  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-06-20 01:17  arwalker

	* : Correctly read in demo.kst

2004-06-19 18:13  hausmann

	* : - need the declaration of i18n to compile

2004-06-18 19:53  staikos

	* : quick fix to make Apply Edits trigger a repaint

2004-06-18 19:42  staikos

	* : another assertion failure that can go, though I'm not sure how I
	  was able to actually trigger it.

2004-06-18 19:39  staikos

	* : properly fix the assertion error

2004-06-18 17:53  arwalker

	* : Fix semantic problem. It was previously fixed for dragging
	  within the same plot, but is now also fixed for dragging across
	  plots. Allow dragging of labels across windows. Explicitly deny
	  dragging of legends across windows.

2004-06-18 15:51  staikos

	* : not good

2004-06-18 15:44  staikos

	* : demo.kst at least doesn't work still

2004-06-18 15:43  staikos

	* : - re-add my debugging hooks - the semantic problem with label
	  dragging still exists

2004-06-17 22:55  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-17 22:53  staikos

	* : After another marathon of debugging, get X-axis border
	  adjustments working inward as well as outward. Unfortunately it's
	  also O(n^2) which somewhat irritates me.

2004-06-17 22:43  arwalker

	* : Actually make layout mode part of the radio group. A window will
	  leave/enter layout mode when it is given the focus, or if it is
	  the active window when the mode is changed.

2004-06-17 22:12  staikos

	* : in general these interfaces look good to me. I normalized some
	  of the notation style since this is a public API. Also, it's best
	  to prefer US English for public APIs (color vs colour)

2004-06-17 22:10  arwalker

	* : Previously if there were no windows in existence then the last
	  page of the data wizard would have the Current Window option
	  selected but disabled. This has now been fixed.

2004-06-17 21:55  rchern

	* : Suggested (only) functions to be able to create Events,
	  Histograms, and Power Spectra. Also be able to change plot axes
	  scales and maximize plots.

2004-06-17 21:33  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-06-17 21:26  staikos

	* : finally (after a rediculous amount of debugging) get clipping
	  working for the rest of the painting (tie boxes, zoom rects, etc)

2004-06-17 19:58  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warning Removed unnecessary define's Fixed
	  FIXME

2004-06-17 17:56  rchern

	* : Filter set proposal added to devel-docs per Andrew's request

2004-06-17 17:21  staikos

	* : a tip from Maksim about an Xft bug

2004-06-17 16:49  staikos

	* : cache the last clip region for paint hacks like zooming and tie
	  boxes

2004-06-17 16:19  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-17 16:15  staikos

	* : eliminate a good deal of flicker, especially in layout mode

2004-06-17 05:12  staikos

	* : drawing is much faster now - eliminated unnecessary internal
	  redraws - profiling shows a big improvement, and it's very
	  noticeable with, for example, dragging labels

2004-06-16 21:42  staikos

	* : - make the KMdiChildView* helper methods work (dynamic_cast was
	  incorrect) - correct KstSharedPtr usage - remove unneeded
	  variables - delay creation of objects until (and only if) they are
	  needed - reformat - remove unneeded tests for null - add tests for
	  null after dynamic_cast - remove dead code

2004-06-16 20:47  rchern

	* : Attempted to implement remaining FIXME's for DCOP functions.

2004-06-16 20:07  staikos

	* : implement tie voting and tieing across plots

2004-06-16 19:30  staikos

	* : don't allow labels and legends outside the plot rect

2004-06-16 19:14  staikos

	* : not entirely sure why yet, but this assert was triggering for me
	  until I split it in two. Now I can't reproduce the problem

2004-06-16 19:12  binner

	* : CVS_SILENT fixuifiles

2004-06-16 17:07  arwalker

2004-06-16 13:05  netterfield

	* : Starting to limit vectorDialog when used to create a new
	  vector...

2004-06-16 05:31  staikos

	* : tied zoom action is implemented, but not as a toggle. It
	  presently just enables tied zoom for all plots in the active
	  window.

2004-06-16 04:41  staikos

	* : make the tie boxes look more like the old ones

2004-06-16 01:49  staikos

	* : the usual :)

2004-06-16 01:33  netterfield

	* : -Added key accels everywhere. -changed mouse mode radio icons to
	  be smaller, so it is easier to see they are pressed
	  -quickpsddialog uses a kurlline edity thingy -redrawing the line
	  type in curve appearance widget doesn't make it grow anymore
	  (still not ideal, but less bad now).

2004-06-15 21:02  staikos

	* : don't return references to local variables

2004-06-15 20:28  staikos

	* : get rid of a lot of flicker - there's still some in the layout
	  code though.

2004-06-15 19:23  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warning.

2004-06-15 19:07  arwalker

	* : More DCOP interface functionality.

2004-06-15 17:23  arwalker

	* : More DCOP interface functionality.

2004-06-15 17:22  staikos

	* : Don't repaint in the wrong painter (or even at all, actually)

2004-06-11 23:02  arwalker

2004-06-11 16:12  staikos

	* : various fixes

2004-06-11 00:53  staikos

	* : - can't reproduce crash with "m" - m shouldn't even work in
	  label mode :)

2004-06-11 00:52  staikos

	* : listed elsewhere or fixed

2004-06-11 00:38  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT normalize, correct typos

2004-06-11 00:24  staikos

	* : - show the plot focus in the tie box as the old one did -
	  enhance some of the template members in KstViewObject to work with
	  methods from derived classes I think I may have introduced an
	  inefficieny somewhere because loading Kst files is really slow
	  right now. I'm not sure why.

2004-06-10 22:55  staikos

	* : Make the keys bind as they did in the previous view code to
	  avoid confusing Barth. :-) Also repair tied zoom after the last
	  commit.

2004-06-10 22:45  rchern

	* : Make x-zoom and y-zoom shortcut keys consistent with actual zoom

2004-06-10 22:26  staikos

	* : X axis alignment completed

2004-06-10 21:14  staikos

	* : first half of x-left alignment. It requires "user intervention"
	  to activate at the moment because it doesn't trigger updates in
	  all the other plots. I'm trying to avoid an O(n^2) paint problem
	  which is why the obvious algorithm isn't implemented yet.

2004-06-10 20:31  arwalker

	* : First draft of the view fits functionality. We probably now need
	  to add the list of parameter names to each fit, as without it the
	  parameter values aren't particularly useful.

2004-06-10 18:42  staikos

	* : dcop interface proposal

2004-06-10 18:31  staikos

	* : make zooming behave as it did before

2004-06-10 00:53  arwalker

	* : Start to add dialog to display the parameters and covariance
	  matrix of a fit.

2004-06-09 23:14  arwalker

	* : fix KstShared usage and make removal of curves work from the
	  menu

2004-06-09 20:05  arwalker

	* : Made deletePlot( ) functional. Sorry, I just noticed that George
	  is down for DCOP so I'll hold off on any more changes here.

2004-06-09 19:32  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-06-09 19:27  staikos

2004-06-09 17:13  rchern

	* : Added bin SUBDIR

2004-06-09 17:11  rchern

	* : Bin plugin to bin data.

2004-06-09 15:21  netterfield

	* : Get rid of the possibly unsafe printf...

2004-06-09 13:10  netterfield

	* : vector defaults remembers psd settings improved behavior for
	  wizard plot/window creation layout mode is a mouse mode like zooms
	  and text: now in same radio group.

2004-06-09 07:23  staikos

	* : add paste back

2004-06-09 06:04  staikos

	* : data mode feedback support

2004-06-09 05:32  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-09 05:29  staikos

	* : the rest of the tied zooming code

2004-06-09 04:34  staikos

	* : a good chunk of tied zoom is working - only a few zooms don't
	  work yet

2004-06-08 20:36  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-08 20:34  staikos

	* : minor datamode fixes

2004-06-08 20:27  staikos

	* : repainting is a good idea

2004-06-08 20:24  staikos

	* : half of data mode, for what it's worth. :-)

2004-06-08 20:00  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings.

2004-06-08 19:56  staikos

	* : found out why the coordinates are wrong :)

2004-06-08 19:48  staikos

	* : minor fixlets, and stub for data mode

2004-06-08 19:39  staikos

	* : don't flicker the zoom box

2004-06-08 19:37  staikos

	* : missing update()s - is this a good idea, or even the right
	  approach? We need to make update() threadsafe now

2004-06-08 19:35  staikos

	* : fix assertion, update fixes

2004-06-08 19:23  arwalker

	* : Some FIXMEs and compiler warnings.

2004-06-08 19:07  staikos

	* : reduce most of the flicker, but introduce a bug while I'm at it.
	  Kst2DPlot coordinates are internally messed up at this point for
	  some reason. I also suspect that we will have to remove all the
	  public member variables and add methods instead, since we probably
	  don't always update when we need to anymore

2004-06-08 14:51  staikos

	* : no longer a valid comment

2004-06-08 10:50  coles

	* : CVS_SILENT Corrected typos.

2004-06-08 02:10  netterfield

	* : More datawizard tweaks...

2004-06-07 22:02  arwalker

	* : Added the ability to apply label and legend changse to a single
	  plot, all plots in a given window, or all plots. Ths also removes
	  some FIXMEs, which now stand at 83 in number.

2004-06-07 21:20  rchern

	* : Informal test guideline for kst.

2004-06-07 17:04  arwalker

	* : It always pays to be explicit.

2004-06-07 16:34  staikos

	* : revert last. Causes a lengthy list of memory errors, though it
	  looked fine to me on first glance.

2004-06-05 17:35  staikos

	* : Proper form for kst shared pointers

2004-06-05 17:18  staikos

	* : I see no reason to remove this type - all other objects have it
	  for consistency

2004-06-05 17:01  arwalker

	* : I have reverted the reversions. The change I made was correct.
	  The problem was that KstSharedPtr was not checking the correct
	  values for the deletion of an object. As a result once any
	  KstSharedPtr object was created it was never destroyed. You can
	  confirm this by placing a breakpoint on the destructor of objects
	  like KstVCurve. The execution will never break there. Also, if you
	  watch the data manager, the reference count on vectors will never
	  go down, even when you delete the curves that use them. Fixing the
	  problem in KstSharedPtr exposed other memory problems, hence the
	  crashes. I've fixed one major problem, but there may be others
	  left to be found. Now that objects are actually getting deleted
	  previously hidden problems are emerging.

2004-06-05 16:37  arwalker

	* : Include order.

2004-06-05 02:38  netterfield

	* : A recent commit to the line changed here produced an impressive
	  crash. This manually reverts it...

2004-06-04 23:15  arwalker

	* : Delete the object when we're finished with it.

2004-06-04 23:12  arwalker

	* : Cleaned up the includes.

2004-06-04 23:00  arwalker

	* : Remove unused variables.

2004-06-04 22:16  staikos

	* : reactivate the dcop interface. It still needs a lot of work
	  though. Some methods remain disabled, and I think we need to
	  change many of them. We need to re-evaluate their design to
	  determine what still makes sense, and what should change.

2004-06-04 20:59  staikos

	* : compile

2004-06-04 20:48  arwalker

	* : Didn't mean to commit the previous one.

2004-06-04 20:44  arwalker

	* : Wa have KstViewWindow::immediatePrintToPng so might as well use
	  it.

2004-06-04 20:41  staikos

	* : don't crash

2004-06-04 20:32  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT hehehe

2004-06-04 20:31  staikos

	* : fixed shift+mouse actions, and added support for CTRL+A,
	  CTRL+SHIFT+A, and shift+rubberband

2004-06-04 20:31  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-06-04 19:52  staikos

	* : added CTRL+A, CTRL+SHIFT+A in layout mode, and make some cases
	  more strict for passthrough of events

2004-06-04 19:30  staikos

	* : Escape cancels layout operations

2004-06-04 19:16  staikos

	* : done

2004-06-04 18:59  arwalker

	* : When aligning objects make sure they all remain fully within the
	  window, to be consistent with the inability to move a plot even
	  partially outside a window.

2004-06-04 18:55  staikos

	* : restore zoom mode correctly

2004-06-04 18:51  staikos

	* : because it breaks things, that's why

2004-06-04 18:36  staikos

	* : missing case

2004-06-04 18:21  staikos

	* : legend dragging, and misc fixes, especially header related

2004-06-04 18:21  arwalker

	* : Another FIXME... 77 to go.

2004-06-04 17:53  staikos

	* : repaint to erase old labels after a drop

2004-06-04 17:48  arwalker

	* : Fixed a couple of FIXMEs. Now correctly delete the windows when
	  closing Kst and close all open windows when opening a new
	  document.

2004-06-04 17:16  arwalker

	* : Reload a saved fit curve.

2004-06-04 16:40  arwalker

	* : Style changes

2004-06-04 14:30  netterfield

	* : 3.2 --> 3.1 :-(

2004-06-04 14:22  netterfield

	* : Add auto-legend choice in wizard, and make it the default: (if
	  there is more than 1 curve per plot, use a legend in that plot)

2004-06-04 01:05  staikos

	* : label dragging mostly working now (but still buggy)

2004-06-04 00:14  arwalker

	* : Handle resizing of the curve appearance widget.

2004-06-03 23:28  staikos

	* : labels are editable again

2004-06-03 23:26  arwalker

	* : Add event monitor entry to data manager.

2004-06-03 22:40  staikos

2004-06-03 21:30  arwalker

	* : Modified the event monitor system to better fit with the
	  existing architecture.

2004-06-03 20:26  staikos

	* : after a very lengthy battle with KMDI, this now closes the
	  active view when an open is done if the active view is empty.

2004-06-03 00:57  staikos

	* : merge the new piolib patch

2004-06-02 18:50  arwalker

	* : Make event monitoring functional again. Its worth noting that
	  the parser and scanner are linked components. Rather than add back
	  the event scanner for the second time events are now using the
	  existing parser and scanner. Start adding e-mail functionality.

2004-06-01 22:55  arwalker

	* : Save a small amount of memory

2004-06-01 22:00  netterfield

	* : Implement PSD properties... 'Each in own plot' produces enough
	  plots in XY+PSD mode.

2004-06-01 19:22  arwalker

	* : Make sure we can find plots within groups.

2004-06-01 18:57  arwalker

	* : Set the current window to the active window when the plot dialog
	  is shown. This is most likely what the user intended.

2004-06-01 18:33  arwalker

	* : Removed a superfluous separator.

2004-06-01 18:16  netterfield

	* : Grumble.... 3.1 not 3.2....

2004-06-01 18:16  arwalker

	* : Allow multiple selections in the available and plotted curves
	  list, so that moving a large number of curves is much quicker.

2004-06-01 17:33  netterfield

	* : More burr removal in data wizard. Add KST::suggestWinName();

2004-06-01 17:00  arwalker

	* : Make the "New:" more obvious

2004-06-01 16:46  arwalker

	* : Improved behaviour on resizing and changing plugins.

2004-05-31 23:04  rchern

	* : Added readable names.

2004-05-31 22:18  arwalker

	* : Added readable name.

2004-05-31 22:16  arwalker

	* : Added the concept of a readable name for plugins. This will be
	  displayed in the plugin and fit dialog, and does not have to be
	  the same as the function name. Thus, spaces can be used instead of
	  underscores.

2004-05-31 21:43  staikos

	* : - initialize variables - start the label tool code

2004-05-31 21:12  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-05-31 21:12  staikos

	* : from another copy of the list I had kicking around

2004-05-31 21:10  staikos

	* : cvs commit has a way of refreshing one's memory quickly

2004-05-31 21:10  arwalker

	* : Allow the user to enter a value directly into the plugin and fit
	  dialog for input scalars, without having to explicitly create a
	  scalar value. If necessary a scalar is implicitly created.

2004-05-31 21:09  staikos

	* : remove done items, add new items - all I can think of anyway

2004-05-31 21:06  staikos

	* : hook in the global zoom setting actions and obey them

2004-05-31 18:13  staikos

	* : some subtle mouse handling fixes

2004-05-31 18:13  arwalker

	* : Added method for a scalar selector to be directly editable. The
	  intention here is to allow the user to enter a value directly
	  rather than being forced to create a scalar first.

2004-05-31 16:02  staikos

	* : Make it compile again, but I'm not sure the event is going to
	  the right object. It doesn't appear to be handled.

2004-05-29 21:52  staikos

	* : remove debug

2004-05-28 21:19  staikos

	* : Get it compiling again

2004-05-28 19:33  arwalker

	* : Export graphics files.

2004-05-28 19:27  staikos

	* : initialize variable

2004-05-28 19:08  staikos

	* : - silly me, we already had those two menu entries :) - rewrite
	  the edit/fit/remove submenus to not store the menu as a member.
	  that won't work because the view could change, and also because it
	  holds actions that we don't want held

2004-05-28 18:42  netterfield

	* : Data wizard improvements Add general vector default system (uses
	  kconfig)

2004-05-28 18:34  staikos

	* : add menu entries, and a few minor fixlets

2004-05-28 17:54  staikos

	* : the rest of the zoom/scroll/etc actions implemented. menu
	  entries to follow

2004-05-28 17:27  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT save first, commit second

2004-05-28 17:25  staikos

	* : - add cleanup to the menu - some fixlets - add scrolling - add
	  zoom-single keyboard binding

2004-05-28 17:06  staikos

	* : - add log scale support back - respond to key press, not
	  release, for actions

2004-05-28 08:56  staikos

	* : hook in several more zooming accelerators

2004-05-28 08:43  staikos

	* : more off-by-one style bug fixes

2004-05-28 08:21  staikos

	* : eliminate unnecessary repaint and enable zoom-previous

2004-05-28 08:12  staikos

	* : finally track down most of the mouse zoom handling issues. very
	  tricky, and I think this event handling code from KstView should
	  be completely rethought. I started refactoring some of it but it
	  clearly isn't working too well.

2004-05-27 23:32  arwalker

	* : Added a layout mode toolbar button. Some additional thought
	  needs to be taken with the different modes. Currently we have zoom
	  modes, label mode, data mode, and layout mode. At present the zoom
	  modes and label mode are radio buttons, while the latter modes are
	  toggle buttons. This clearly should be changed, but to what needs
	  some discussion.

2004-05-27 19:36  arwalker

	* : Print to png.

2004-05-27 19:03  arwalker

	* : This should make printing fully functional.

2004-05-27 09:55  staikos

	* : some better keyboard handling and zooming feedback. only one
	  major bug left I think.

2004-05-27 07:09  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-05-27 01:24  arwalker

	* : First draft of printing support.

2004-05-26 18:35  arwalker

	* : Added printing

2004-05-26 17:31  arwalker

	* : Restore the datawizard to a more convenient size, especially if
	  you're working on a 800x600 resolution screen.

2004-05-26 17:05  arwalker

	* : Compile under Qt 3.1.2

2004-05-26 16:45  netterfield

	* : Rudamentry default file name in data wizard. More to come...
	  'Search' button active. Lots more to do!

2004-05-26 00:33  arwalker

	* : Fixed problems with saving and loading, which should now be
	  fully functional.

2004-05-25 18:26  arwalker

	* : Get things to build under Qt 3.1.2

2004-05-25 13:38  staikos

	* : activate new mdi windows after creating them - fixes focus bug

2004-05-25 09:37  staikos

	* : disable currentWindow radio when it's not usable. There must be
	  a bug in KMDI that's causing this condition.

2004-05-25 07:58  staikos

	* : I'm still trying to figure out why it's broken, but this fixes
	  the big crash I'm seeing

2004-05-25 04:38  netterfield

	* : Some reworking of the datawizard. Not all functionality is
	  there, but the appearance is....

2004-05-25 00:07  staikos

	* : various bug fixes, more mouse/keyboard handling work

2004-05-22 04:59  staikos

	* : implement more mouse handling including X, Y, XY zooming

2004-05-22 03:47  netterfield

	* : A bit better icon..

2004-05-22 03:43  netterfield

	* : Barth Style icon for layout mode...

2004-05-21 21:27  arwalker

	* : save and load the base properties

2004-05-21 20:23  arwalker

	* : Removed test view. Added layout mode, which acts on the current
	  view only. Added saving and loading, not yet fully tested.

2004-05-20 22:26  arwalker

	* : Compile.

2004-05-20 22:09  arwalker

	* : Delete the iterator after use.

2004-05-20 21:29  arwalker

	* : Slightly more convenient to have the old object name already
	  present.

2004-05-20 21:27  staikos

	* : much of the zooming code is in and working, but there is still
	  lots of work to do it seems. There are lots of bugs lurking.

2004-05-20 21:14  arwalker

	* : Added the Window immediately before the Help menu, if we can
	  find it.

2004-05-20 20:30  arwalker

	* : Made plotDialog private and added accessor function

2004-05-20 19:57  arwalker

	* : Added default kmdi menu

2004-05-20 19:20  staikos

	* : more mouse handling, some header cleanup, and store the grid
	  settings (still incomplete)

2004-05-20 18:51  arwalker

	* : Fix for unzooming a plot within a zoomed group.

2004-05-20 18:35  arwalker

	* : More efficient.

2004-05-20 18:24  arwalker

	* : Don't actually remove an object from its group when raising and
	  lowering. Instead we go to the lower level.

2004-05-20 16:42  staikos

	* : mouse handling round 1: - events are passed down to the proper
	  object - cursor is changed - theoretically some of the zooming and
	  dragging works - also use bitfields for bools and small numbers in
	  the base class to save memory

2004-05-20 16:34  arwalker

	* : Zoom Zoom

2004-05-20 15:11  staikos

	* : restore TODOs and fix a return code

2004-05-20 14:50  arwalker

	* : Handle deleting a plot from within a group.

2004-05-20 14:18  arwalker

	  size scaled by the aspect.

2004-05-20 12:45  arwalker

	* : Fix minor UI issue

2004-05-20 12:14  arwalker

	  matrix and fit parameters.

2004-05-19 23:28  arwalker

	* : indenting

2004-05-19 20:52  staikos

	* : add support for grabbing the mouse, mouse event stubs, and
	  storing the number of columns in grid mode

2004-05-19 20:21  staikos

	* : search for mouse handling objects in display mode. handling to
	  follow

2004-05-19 20:19  arwalker

	* : Added i18n

2004-05-19 20:14  arwalker

	* : Restore the last used MDI mode when kst is started.

2004-05-19 19:50  staikos

	* : small fixlets, set focus, hide unimplemented feature in filters

2004-05-19 19:20  arwalker

	* : Bring up the correct plot when editing a plot from the context
	  menu.

2004-05-19 16:16  arwalker

	* : Only add separator if necessary.

2004-05-19 16:07  staikos

	* : childframe mode readded

2004-05-18 00:31  staikos

	* : repair last commit

2004-05-18 00:31  staikos

	* : forward port missing portion of last commit

2004-05-18 00:26  staikos

	  missed.

2004-05-17 20:08  arwalker

	* : Compile

2004-05-17 16:31  arwalker

	* : Put the generated fit in the same window as the original curve.

2004-05-16 17:36  staikos

	* : compile

2004-05-15 00:35  arwalker

	* : Menu items and such like...

2004-05-14 15:46  staikos

	* : forward port compile fix

2004-05-14 04:55  staikos

	* : while I'm in here....

2004-05-14 00:51  arwalker

	* : Make findChildrenType recursive

2004-05-14 00:50  arwalker

	* : Continue with fit dialog

2004-05-13 22:42  arwalker

	* : Check drop object type.

2004-05-13 14:21  staikos

	* : - add in the plot dialog again, to an extent - make the view
	  object template for finding a child list a bit more user friendly
	  - fix uninit variable in the event monitor

2004-05-13 01:06  arwalker

	* : Add edit curve functionality

2004-05-12 23:45  arwalker

	* : Fixed UI problem with logging type.

2004-05-12 19:36  arwalker

	  connected.

2004-05-12 17:50  arwalker

	* : Make menu items, data manager entries, and dialog titles more
	  consistent

2004-05-12 17:37  arwalker

	* : Added back the quick curve and quick psd functionality.

2004-05-12 16:13  arwalker

	* : Keep the naming conventions consistent

2004-05-12 04:27  arwalker

	* : Ability to edit label properties

2004-05-11 00:26  helio

	* : - Fix compilation

2004-05-11 00:26  staikos

	* : update to KMDI-HEAD

2004-05-10 23:38  arwalker

	* : Move the focus rect and selection rect inside of the contents
	  rect. This allows us to the focus/selection even when the plot is
	  the full size of the window or is one plot arranged on a uniform
	  grid.

2004-05-10 22:54  netterfield

	* : Command line makes plots again.

2004-05-10 21:18  arwalker

	* : Prevent a crash by ensuring that we are not trying to write to
	  plot.end(); which is not a valid plot.

2004-05-10 19:30  arwalker

	* : Disable the currently active MDI mode, so the user knows which
	  mode they are in.

2004-05-09 20:12  staikos

	* : split out layout mode and non-layout mode popup menus

2004-05-09 19:39  arwalker

	* : Standardize fit plugins

2004-05-09 09:12  wstephens

	* : Correct URL

2004-05-07 22:23  staikos

	* : plot layout fixes, and generate new plots using the template
	  method in KstTopLevelView

2004-05-07 18:03  arwalker

	* : Fixed build errors.

2004-05-07 17:40  staikos

	* : unsermake compilation patch from Waldo

2004-05-07 07:59  staikos

	* : the rest of the data wizard, and repairs to KstObjectList

2004-05-07 04:23  staikos

	* : port half of the datawizard to the new view code, adding support
	  for views

2004-05-06 22:38  staikos

	* : port to the new view code

2004-05-06 21:58  staikos

	* : port most of PSDs to the new view code

2004-05-06 21:31  staikos

	* : fix some bugs and implement equation creation and plotting as
	  the first example. Layout mode is no-longer the default. Grid
	  layout is still not implemented

2004-05-06 20:30  staikos

	* : implement a big chunk of the new plot handling. this is mostly
	  centered around creation and management of view windows

2004-05-06 16:27  arwalker

	* : Cancel the drag operation if the object(s) being dragged are
	  dragged back into the window they originated from.

2004-05-06 02:02  staikos

	* : The next step in the integration phase - disable kstplot,
	  kstview, kstmouse. This breaks much more, but in a good way. :-)
	  With this commit I have marked all the locations that we need to
	  patch to integrate the new view code. Grep for "FIXMEPLOTLIST" for
	  more info. kst dcop iface is completely disabled for now because
	  it's too intertwined with the old plot code.

2004-05-03 16:29  netterfield

	* : Port kstplot stuff into kst2dplot. kst2dplot now has all (???)
	  of the functionality of the old kstplot and can paint and scale,
	  etc... It still uses kstlabel and kstlegendbox.

2004-05-03 02:26  staikos

	* : attempting to fix solaris 9 / gcc 3.3 build

2004-04-29 18:19  staikos

	* : integrate the equation node visitor as implemented by Andrew
	  Coles (thanks!) This should make it easy to implement new types of
	  optimizations! (in which case we should create
	  Equation::optimize() to run them all, perhaps with bitfield to
	  indicate which ones to run)

2004-04-29 13:51  coles

	* : Corrected typos (effects -> affects; used a semicolon to join
	  two sentence fragments).

2004-04-28 21:34  arwalker

	* : Make drag/drop work correctly for grouped objects.

2004-04-28 20:49  staikos

	* : jobs

2004-04-28 20:41  staikos

	* : 1) revert last - I put all that code in for a reason. I want to
	  be able to cancel drag when the user returns to the source. I just
	  haven't found the right hack to make it work yet. Without this
	  behaviour, the user gets extremely frustrated when he moves a
	  small object close to a border. 2) modifiers must not affect
	  object-moves-in-progress, slowly fixing again

2004-04-28 20:18  arwalker

	* : Better handle drag/drop when the source and target are the same.

2004-04-28 20:14  staikos

	* : this if () is not necessary

2004-04-28 19:34  staikos

	* : allow access to the view from the window

2004-04-28 19:09  arwalker

	* : The KstPSDCurve constructor is not expecting the length of FFT
	  vector, but instead its log2(length).

2004-04-28 18:07  arwalker

	* : Added ability to select or de-select a single object by
	  shift+left click when it has the focus.

2004-04-28 16:18  arwalker

	* : Accept a mouse move event even if we have the ALT, CTRL, or
	  SHIFT key pressed. This prevents some odd focus issues.

2004-04-28 15:47  arwalker

	* : We'll need a fit curve class eventually to handle the parameters
	  and covariance matrix. At present this is essentially a copy of
	  kstvcurve.

2004-04-28 15:45  staikos

	* : new window should create a new view -> remove the two testviews.
	  you can create them manually now -> sizes are set to 0 right now -
	  must fix later

2004-04-28 14:56  staikos

	* : flicker--

2004-04-28 03:22  staikos

	* : compile

2004-04-27 23:59  arwalker

	* : Added period to end of sentence.

2004-04-27 22:17  arwalker

	* : Added the ability to create PSDs from the data wizard.

2004-04-27 20:23  arwalker

	* : Added 3d-plotting class

2004-04-27 19:51  staikos

	* : - share the scanner, especially since they're identical

2004-04-27 19:30  staikos

	* : merge in comparison operations

2004-04-27 18:39  staikos

	* : styleguide fix

2004-04-27 18:32  arwalker

	* : Minor UI changes

2004-04-27 17:51  arwalker

	* : Added fit dialog for dynamic fitting of a curve.

2004-04-27 17:17  arwalker

	* : Added the dynamic fit curve menu.

2004-04-27 17:06  arwalker

	* : Issue a warning when Kst is started if the Symbol font is not
	  installed.

2004-04-27 02:17  staikos

	* : compile

2004-04-26 23:21  arwalker

	* : Get things building under KDE 3.1. Probably not the most elegant
	  solution, but it works for now.

2004-04-26 22:31  arwalker

	* : Have a plugin keep track of whether it is a fit, and if so
	  whether it is weighted.

2004-04-26 22:23  arwalker

	* : Standardize fits

2004-04-26 19:34  staikos

	* : this should also be local

2004-04-26 19:34  staikos

	* : more <>->""

2004-04-26 18:54  arwalker

	* : Continue getting things to build

2004-04-26 18:22  arwalker

	* : Get things to build under KDE 3.1

2004-04-26 18:21  arwalker

	* : Not needed as part of build

2004-04-26 06:21  staikos

	* : Patch from Matthew Truch

2004-04-25 20:05  staikos

	* : let's see what the thoughts are on the different MDI modes

2004-04-25 19:46  staikos

	* : And now we start to horribly break Kst in order to integrate
	  KMDI. - MDI is partially integrated - kst generally doesn't work -
	  extensions are disabled until we rework viewObject() - testview is
	  now a QWidget and a sample is created as an MDI child - updates
	  are broken - some dcop interfaces are disabled

2004-04-25 18:19  staikos

	* : rotate

2004-04-25 04:54  staikos

	* : of course :)

2004-04-25 04:48  staikos

	* : configure check for kmdi

2004-04-25 04:23  staikos

	* : add the rest of the necessary files, update to HEAD, make it
	  compile

2004-04-24 06:45  arwalker

	* : Base various alignment, resizing algorithms on focus view
	  object.

2004-04-23 22:31  staikos

	* : import KMDI - doesn't compile yet

2004-04-23 19:19  arwalker

	* : Added ability to align plots left, right, top, and bottom. Added
	  ability to make plots same width, height, and size.

2004-04-23 17:16  arwalker

	* : Moved contentsRect( ) to KstViewObject, as this will be needed
	  for proper resizing later.

2004-04-23 16:54  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-04-23 16:53  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT right branch this time

2004-04-23 15:57  arwalker

	* : Better handle resizing by only updating the aspect of child
	  windows when necessary. This now allows us to shrink the parent to
	  a very small size and retain the correct aspect ratios when the
	  parent is restored to its original size.

2004-04-23 02:50  staikos

	* : parentResized() should be recursive as noted, but
	  updateFromAspect() should not be. - revert last, fix
	  parentResized()

2004-04-23 02:45  staikos

	* : no reason to disable this in HEAD now

2004-04-23 01:29  arwalker

	* : Make things truly recursive so we can resize deeper than one
	  level.

2004-04-23 00:30  arwalker

	* : Added ability to distinguish between a standard fit and a
	  regular plugin.

2004-04-22 18:52  arwalker

	* : Added support for curve line width and style.

2004-04-22 17:14  netterfield

	* : Shouldn't have commited Makefile.am...

2004-04-22 17:13  netterfield

	* : new kst_datawizard icon...

2004-04-22 14:05  arwalker

	* : Added an update button to handle the situation where the ELOG
	  server becomes available after starting Kst, or the ELOG server
	  configuration is changed.

2004-04-22 13:46  arwalker

	* : Several minor UI enhancements

2004-04-21 22:53  arwalker

	* : Added optimization of the event monitor reporting. Up to 100
	  messages are now batched together if they occur within one minute
	  of each other.

2004-04-21 20:14  arwalker

	* : Add a description for events, and use it if available. If no
	  description is given then use the expression text itself.

2004-04-20 16:53  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-04-20 16:52  staikos

	* : various bug fixes, label dragging

2004-04-20 15:55  staikos

	* : store the ascent information, fix computation of it, and
	  therefore position the label properly in the buffer

2004-04-20 10:20  staikos

	* : added computation of the text geometry for the selected font and
	  size, and support for justification. Will need to split this into
	  ascent and descent since subscript makes the text dip below the
	  baseline.

2004-04-20 09:22  staikos

	* : implement ^ _ and {} in labels

2004-04-20 07:37  staikos

	* : back buffer implementation

2004-04-20 07:37  staikos

	* : a good chunk of the label parsing and rendering code. the parser
	  will be slightly reworked after this.

2004-04-18 06:17  staikos

	* : added support for dragging plot groups and undoing drags when
	  re-entering the view that started the drag. drag re-enter is buggy
	  still.

2004-04-18 06:15  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-04-18 05:13  staikos

	* : save and restore bordered view object properties too, and allow
	  other view objects to save/restore their properties

2004-04-16 08:02  staikos

	* : clear the selection when changing out of layout mode

2004-04-16 07:55  staikos

	* : my list

2004-04-16 07:41  staikos

	* : dragging of Kst2DPlots is now partially functional within Kst
	  instances.

2004-04-16 06:15  staikos

	* : more files, create a second view to test dnd

2004-04-16 06:14  staikos

	* : lots of view work, including most of drag and drop implemented -
	  though it's still not functional

2004-04-15 18:56  arwalker

	* : Some minor improvements to data mode: * remove the flicker when
	  the mouse is moved, but the same data point remains selected *
	  draw the data mode indicator more efficiently Also, if the x
	  vector is not monotonic then we are stuck doing a linear search
	  (N) for the nearest point. It might be worthwhile to do a
	  quicksort of the vector (NlogN) which would initially be more
	  costly but subsequent mouse moves would be much quicker. Given
	  that there will generally be a lot of mouse moves while in data
	  mode it will most likely be more efficient in the long run.

2004-04-15 18:32  staikos

	* : ah now I understand, you didn't want orphans, you just wanted
	  them to not be saved

2004-04-15 18:20  staikos

	* : make these scalars really orphan

2004-04-15 17:49  staikos

	* : proper fix for the bug in the list partitioner

2004-04-15 17:44  staikos

	* : add testcase for bug recently fixed

2004-04-15 17:42  arwalker

	* : Added some default scalar values that define some (hopefully)
	  useful physical constants. These are deliberately orphaned so they
	  are not saved with every kst file.

2004-04-15 16:54  arwalker

	* : Prevent stray curves from remaining after we do File...New

2004-04-15 15:57  arwalker

	* : This makes the whole thing work.

2004-04-15 05:53  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-14 23:40  arwalker

	* : The plugin dialog update( ... ) function is really two seperate
	  functions. One for updating the list of scalars and vectors within
	  the input comboboxes and the other (already existing) to handle
	  changes in the plugin itself. These functions have now been split,
	  as previously creating a new scalar or vector within the plugin
	  dialog would cause any modified settings to revert back to those
	  of the last created plugin.

2004-04-14 22:10  mueller

	* : fix compile

2004-04-14 19:21  arwalker

	* : Fixed build problems.

2004-04-14 19:12  arwalker

	* : Added plugin for addition of Gaussian noise (of specified sigma)
	  to a vector

2004-04-14 19:09  arwalker

	* : Prevent name conflicts

2004-04-14 18:33  arwalker

	* : Make sure the buffer is large enough.

2004-04-14 16:42  arwalker

	* : Do some translation and draw the line breaking input and output
	  across the entire width of the dialog.

2004-04-14 16:29  arwalker

	* : Plugin objects are updated as part of the ncl list now the
	  underlying problem is fixed.

2004-04-14 16:22  arwalker

	* : Ensure that we don't add a NULL pointer to the exclusive list.

2004-04-14 00:52  staikos

	* : don't mask bugs, crash and then generate a bt with testcase so
	  it can be fixed.

2004-04-13 23:01  arwalker

	* : Modification based on tests now that plugins are functional
	  again.

2004-04-13 21:18  arwalker

	* : Update the plugin vectors in the new threading model.

2004-04-13 19:37  arwalker

	* : Perform some additional checks before using potentially invalid
	  pointers. This prevents Kst from crashing when using plugins.

2004-04-13 19:18  arwalker

	* : Removed obsolete code.

2004-04-13 18:43  arwalker

	* : Added ability to later limit the number of log messages
	  retained.

2004-04-13 17:24  staikos

	* : not needed now

2004-04-13 01:41  staikos

	* : starting to define a back buffer for painting plots and labels
	  into

2004-04-13 00:57  staikos

	* : make the menus cascade when necessary, add ungrouping, more
	  minor things

2004-04-12 22:44  staikos

	* : selection should be iterative over children, not recursive

2004-04-12 22:23  staikos

	* : added object grouping, fixed some bugs that showed up due to it

2004-04-11 16:57  staikos

	* : Minor move, selection fixlets, and draw the bounding focus rect
	  for a selection move instead of just the object that is focused.
	  This will later be changed to draw the focus rect for each object
	  individually. Bounds checking for move operations was added.

2004-04-11 08:32  staikos

	* : allow selection of objects and move the selected items along
	  with an item that is selected and moved. Does not check bounds on
	  selected items or draw the selected item shadows yet. Selection
	  markers are ugly. Resizing clears the selection.

2004-04-11 00:57  staikos

	* : fix nasty bug on PPC and possibly some other architectures

2004-04-10 23:43  staikos

	* : added the framework for labels in the new view engine The label
	  parser and renderer needs a few changes before it can be ported
	  over

2004-04-10 20:44  staikos

	* : preserve aspect ratio during resize to keep with current Kst
	  behaviour (also keeps relative sizing and positioning - basically
	  the entire geometry aspect is preserved)

2004-04-09 20:54  arwalker

	* : A few UI issues

2004-04-09 20:32  arwalker

	* : Saves the event monitor entries to the kst file

2004-04-09 14:03  deller

	* : fix misplaced #endif - it broke when compiling w/ KDE CVS HEAD

2004-04-09 00:22  arwalker

	* : Add functionality to prepare event monitor for saving to kst
	  file

2004-04-08 23:43  arwalker

	* : Event monitoring (in draft form) are now working: - all output
	  is to the debug log - may want to add e-mail notification - may
	  want to add visual feedback on curve, but it seems if this is the
	  intent it could be done via the creation of an equation curve

2004-04-08 20:54  arwalker

	* : Make the search for a unique Analysis Scalar and unique
	  Anonymous Vector more efficient by remembering the last name that
	  was used.

2004-04-08 20:12  arwalker

	* : Removed a FIXME related to i18n not working

2004-04-08 19:56  staikos

	* : much less flicker, and add new menu items for z-order
	  manipulation

2004-04-08 19:07  arwalker

	* : Provide a more efficient way to terminate the update thread
	  Respect the plot update timer value

2004-04-08 19:04  arwalker

	* : This is what was intended

2004-04-08 16:59  arwalker

	* : Have KstView::printToGraphicsFile( ... ) return a bool to
	  indicate whether or not it was successful.

2004-04-08 10:23  staikos

	* : use "standard actions" that might be common across different
	  view objects to reduce the effort it takes to write new objects

2004-04-08 07:10  staikos

	* : iron out some context menu buglets (I'm getting good at finding
	  weird mouse combinations), remove debug, and add in a bit smoother
	  mouse movement.

2004-04-08 05:52  staikos

	* : add a parent pointer, optimize a call, disable selection when
	  not in layout mode

2004-04-08 05:11  staikos

	* : that's a slot, not a signal

2004-04-08 04:57  staikos

	* : fix some more weird mouse handling cases that were unhandled,
	  add in menu titles

2004-04-08 02:25  staikos

	* : - many little fixlets in event handling. some of them
	  brown-paper-bag worthy - implemented popup menu plugin for objects
	  - implemented deletion of objects from the context menu - enhanced
	  the object API - optimized the rubberband. it's now less flickery
	  than the ones in Qt and KDE even! (might just have to port this
	  over)

2004-04-08 00:53  arwalker

	* : Made event monitor UI fit better with existing architecture

2004-04-07 22:33  arwalker

	* : Removed an obsolete FIXME annotation

2004-04-07 22:25  staikos

	* : the usual

2004-04-07 22:22  arwalker

	* : Protect ourselves from the application also closing

2004-04-07 22:06  arwalker

	* : Ensure a newly created extension is added to the relevant list
	  so we know how to delete it and can avoid creating it again

2004-04-07 22:05  arwalker

	* : Ensure that the UI associated with the extension is removed when
	  it is unloaded

2004-04-07 10:24  staikos

	* : added the start of drag objects for Kst objects and did some
	  work on cleaning up coordinates and making view resize work like
	  the old Kst views (still very far from working)

2004-04-07 07:25  staikos

	* : bounding for the rectangles for resize, select, and move, and
	  some fixlets

2004-04-07 05:30  staikos

	* : rubber banding during move, resize, and selection. selection is
	  not implemented yet. also fix a few buglets

2004-04-06 23:57  arwalker

	* : Continuing with the event monitoring

2004-04-06 20:46  staikos

	* : start the view in display mode now and add a checkbox to toggle
	  layout mode in the test app (defaulted to on)

2004-04-06 20:24  staikos

	* : allow moving of objects

2004-04-06 19:20  staikos

	* : those coordinate calculations were wrong for top-left

2004-04-06 18:59  staikos

	* : Added mouse-driven object resizing - still requires
	  user-feedback on size

2004-04-06 17:51  staikos

	* : oops :)

2004-04-06 17:47  staikos

	* : set the cursor over objects

2004-04-06 16:54  staikos

	* : Well it was too difficult to use "math" coordinates. I was
	  confusing myself endlessly. Let's go back to u-l. This makes
	  cleanup work properly. Now all features implemented so far are
	  working.

2004-04-06 06:43  staikos

	* : fix focus rect and child searching

2004-04-06 06:24  staikos

	* : fix size coordinates

2004-04-06 03:43  staikos

	* : cleanup, clear, painting and sizing fixes - it's really broken
	  now though, need to fix a few more things this broke (later)

2004-04-06 03:12  staikos

	* : more substantial demo of focus handling, drag&drop event
	  handling partially done, selected flag added. view mode tracking
	  added

2004-04-06 02:49  staikos

	* : lots of work on the new view code - painting and resizing works,
	  focus works, and lots of utility functions added to the view
	  object. Event handlers are created but not all in use yet.

2004-04-05 19:34  arwalker

	* : Continue with event monitoring

2004-04-05 17:28  arwalker

	* : Update the event monitor dialog

2004-04-05 07:28  staikos

	* : some notes and geometry code

2004-04-05 02:47  staikos

	* : to keep the code that uses this for comparisons cleaner

2004-04-05 02:29  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-04-05 02:26  staikos

	* : Add in explicit deep copy support. Been testing this one for a
	  week now and it seems to be better and not much slower. We need to
	  make deep copies of the object lists we iterate if they are shared
	  across threads.

2004-04-03 01:35  arwalker

	* : Get the event monitor expression parser working again

2004-04-03 01:34  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings and superfluous commas

2004-04-03 01:33  arwalker

	* : Removed a compiler warning and superfluous commas

2004-04-03 01:32  arwalker

	* : Be more explicit in the value returned for the comparison
	  operators

2004-04-02 00:42  arwalker

	* : Improve performance of the log table

2004-04-01 22:12  arwalker

	* : Minor UI enhancements

2004-04-01 19:51  arwalker

	* : Why not to use regexp's for string replacement

2004-04-01 03:43  staikos

	* : no it really doesn't :-)

2004-04-01 03:39  staikos

	* : make code generation one step shorter

2004-04-01 03:36  staikos

	* : use the global scanner

2004-04-01 03:36  staikos

	* : share the scanner between the two parsers

2004-04-01 03:22  staikos

	* : unneeded. They just duplicate the existing one and add a few
	  things. exparse updated to use the old one again, but this stuff
	  isn't integrated into the build so I haven't tested it yet

2004-04-01 03:19  staikos

	* : no reason to duplicate these files verbatim. I moved exnode*
	  into here.

2004-04-01 01:42  arwalker

	* : Refer to event monitoring "equations" as expressions to avoid
	  naming confusion with equations curves

2004-04-01 01:40  arwalker

	* : Added files for evaluation of event monitoring expressions

2004-03-30 23:41  staikos

	* : added registry for extensions

2004-03-30 22:34  staikos

	* : most of the extension manager implement. Just requires an
	  "extension registry" to keep track of what is already loaded so
	  that new ones can be loaded after startup

2004-03-30 21:15  arwalker

	* : Added UI for event monitoring

2004-03-30 15:41  staikos

	* : Andrew please add this file

2004-03-30 15:30  staikos

	* : added extension manager dialog (not yet functional) extensions
	  now have a bool flag that determines if they are enabled by
	  default

2004-03-30 01:39  arwalker

	* : Add internationalisation

2004-03-30 00:16  arwalker

	* : Added option to save the Kst debugging information to an ELOG
	  entry.

2004-03-29 18:42  arwalker

	* : Added the pass filters to the build

2004-03-29 17:25  arwalker

	* : Added the ELOG functionality to the build

2004-03-29 01:24  staikos

	* : more of the new view code

2004-03-28 10:24  staikos

	* : more of the new view object structure implemented

2004-03-27 04:29  staikos

	* : more of the new object structure

2004-03-26 21:46  arwalker

	* : Avoid some potential deadlocks where a write lock is never
	  unlocked.

2004-03-26 20:03  arwalker

	* : Modified the tab order and layout

2004-03-26 18:42  arwalker

	* : Added Kst version informatoin to the email text. Added labels
	  for the different message types.

2004-03-26 17:40  arwalker

	* : Added ability to hide any specified messages types. Move the
	  generation of the e-mail text to another function so that it could
	  be used by other clients (such as elog).

2004-03-26 16:06  arwalker

	* : Added for log table...

2004-03-26 14:05  staikos

	* : hm no, the file is missing from cvs.

2004-03-26 13:23  staikos

	* : don't exist?

2004-03-26 02:35  arwalker

	* : Make debug dialog more flexible for further enhancements...

2004-03-18 22:35  arwalker

	* : Added additional folders

2004-03-18 22:29  arwalker

	* : Typo.

2004-03-18 22:26  arwalker

	* : Added Butterworth pass filters (low, high, band, and notch)

2004-03-18 21:48  arwalker

	* : Prevented deadlock by moving: KstWriteLocker
	  wl(&KST::vectorList.lock()); beyond the call to vy = new
	  KstRVector( ... ) The problem was that KstRVector implicitly
	  performs a write lock on KST::vectorList in the KstVector
	  constructor. Hence the deadlock.

2004-03-18 20:48  arwalker

	* : Fixed lock

2004-03-18 10:59  staikos

	* : I think this procedure is stable now

2004-03-18 09:25  staikos

	* : revert last - majorly broke loading

2004-03-18 09:17  staikos

	* : "Living on the edge" - Add more #ifdef debug groups for
	  debugging the update thread

2004-03-18 08:42  staikos

	* : after a marathon debugging I learn: When you #ifdef debug
	  messages, only #ifdef the debug messages, and not the code nearby
	  too! On a brighter note, fixed some possible races, added more
	  debug messages, etc

2004-03-18 00:28  staikos

	* : iteration 101

2004-03-17 11:12  coles

	* : Corrected typos.

2004-03-17 05:02  staikos

	* : add helgrind support

2004-03-17 04:17  staikos

	* : trace down lots more nasty locking issues and deadlocks, and get
	  the regression suite back to 100% passes again

2004-03-16 22:50  staikos

	* : playing regression test ping pong

2004-03-16 22:45  staikos

	* : regression suite told me something was wrong. I agree. plugin -1
	  is not a good thing to try to access.

2004-03-16 22:31  arwalker

	* : Disable the ELOG entry dialog if we are not connected to an ELOG
	  logbook.

2004-03-16 22:28  arwalker

	* : Updated some translation settings.

2004-03-16 22:12  staikos

	* : as more people become interested in Kst, I guess it's good to
	  have this stuff documented

2004-03-16 20:43  arwalker

	* : Added dynamic creation of the UI.

2004-03-16 20:36  arwalker

	* : Further changes for ELOG support

2004-03-16 11:41  staikos

	* : a bunch of threading and updating fixes

2004-03-16 10:04  staikos

	* : track down what is perhaps the most difficult bug to find in Kst
	  so far: can't iteratively lock children and then iteratively
	  unlock them while doing a loadInputs() in between because the
	  lists are modified in loadInputs()! The base implementation of the
	  lock should be sufficient in this case since it only ever happens
	  in KstDoc

2004-03-14 19:44  staikos

	* : stop trying to be clever

2004-03-13 20:48  staikos

	* : tracking locking bugs

2004-03-13 15:25  arwalker

	* : Added new event for elog

2004-03-12 23:08  arwalker

	* : Preparing to dynamically create attributes

2004-03-12 19:39  arwalker

	* : Save kst configuration file

2004-03-12 19:37  arwalker

	* : Add code to save kst configuration from ELOG extension

2004-03-12 19:34  arwalker

	* : Split up saveDocument(...) so we can save directly to a
	  QTextStream, which is of use for the ELOG extension.

2004-03-12 17:24  arwalker

	* : Added screen captures.

2004-03-12 17:23  arwalker

	* : Added functionality to allow the ELOG plugin to request a view
	  capture by sending an event.

2004-03-12 12:52  arwalker

	* : UI enhancements

2004-03-11 23:11  arwalker

	* : Forgot this

2004-03-11 23:10  arwalker

	* : First draft for ELOG functionality

2004-03-11 20:32  staikos

	* : prevent view object group from containing an entire view

2004-03-11 20:26  staikos

	* : some of the new view stubs

2004-03-11 20:10  staikos

	* : a view to a view

2004-03-11 16:20  staikos

	* : merged the threading branch into HEAD. Quite buggy still, but
	  will be fixed over time. I recommend using the kst_0_97_release
	  tag if you want a functional Kst.

2004-03-11 15:11  staikos

	* : add debugging info, commented out

2004-03-11 04:28  staikos

	* : 0.98-devel open

2004-03-11 04:21  staikos

	* : Time to release version 0.97

2004-03-11 03:41  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-03-11 03:26  staikos

	* : .kst file mimetype etc

2004-03-11 03:09  staikos

	* : recognize valid and invalid ascii files a bit better

2004-03-10 21:16  staikos

	* : surprise surprise surprise

2004-03-10 21:07  arwalker

	* : Removed connection

2004-03-10 20:33  staikos

	* : Send debug info as email

2004-03-10 19:49  arwalker

	* : As before, but use the existing base class definitions.

2004-03-10 19:26  arwalker

	* : Added functionality to provide a list of the existing field
	  names.

2004-03-10 17:09  staikos

	* : - don't add null entries to the data source list - escape scalar
	  tag names

2004-03-09 22:10  staikos

	* : save log state

2004-03-09 08:46  staikos

	* : - fix axis matching - no wonder, it was autoscaling back to a
	  sane setting after I made it insane!

2004-03-09 03:49  staikos

	* : oops

2004-03-09 03:43  staikos

	* : closer to working. Also cleanup some of the view vectors dialog.
	  It's still got an undefined signal reference

2004-03-09 01:18  staikos

	* : tried to implement axis matching, but it still doesn't work.
	  KstPlot needs to be documented.

2004-03-08 22:41  arwalker

	* : Ensure that the vector selector is updated whenever a new vector
	  is created.

2004-03-08 19:52  staikos

	* : allow log updates in realtime

2004-03-08 19:32  staikos

	* : convert the rest of the core warning/error messages where
	  appropriate to use KstDebug

2004-03-08 19:04  staikos

	* : move to using KstDebug

2004-03-08 09:23  staikos

	* : Added a debug dialog which shows information such as loaded data
	  sources, and a log of Kst events Refactored the version number
	  into a header file

2004-03-05 23:24  staikos

	* : trying very hard to make an icon for the data wizard.

2004-03-05 22:38  staikos

	* : - no need to keep two signals that do the same thing - restore
	  designer indenting in .ui.h file - deref the vector before
	  emitting signal

2004-03-05 21:06  arwalker

	* : Added ability to display any vector as a set of values.

2004-03-05 07:09  staikos

	* : doesn't exist in cvs

2004-03-05 07:08  staikos

	* : misc. wizard bug fixes

2004-03-05 06:47  staikos

	* : no wonder it was so slow :)

2004-03-04 22:22  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-03-04 22:21  staikos

	* : up to the last attempt to get KXMLGUIClient functionality in JS,
	  for Rich to look at

2004-03-04 22:10  staikos

	* : I was wondering why it was still extremely slow, then I saw
	  this.

2004-03-04 21:49  staikos

	* : surprise surprise

2004-03-04 21:44  staikos

	* : make it compile

2004-03-04 21:19  arwalker

	* : Re-enabled the view scalars dialog, with a subclassed QTable,
	  which is more efficient.

2004-03-04 21:06  arwalker

	* : Added subclass of QTable for improved performance.

2004-03-04 20:36  staikos

	* : I guess the label code works better for people when I commit it

2004-03-03 20:55  staikos

	* : add: - starting frame - read to end - read from end - read n
	  samples - boxcar filter - skip

2004-03-03 20:33  staikos

	* : completion for X

2004-03-03 19:49  staikos

	* : progress dialog added

2004-03-03 19:14  staikos

	* : hack together a quick implementation of fieldList() for ascii
	  files

2004-03-03 18:53  staikos

	* : fix legends

2004-03-03 18:44  staikos

	* : that clearly wasn't going to work

2004-03-03 18:37  staikos

	* : add some more functionality to the wizard (more arrangement
	  methods, INDEX), fix a few bugs

2004-03-03 14:05  netterfield

	* : automatic default names get inserted in the plugin dialog if the
	  user applies without entering a name.

2004-03-03 06:10  staikos

	* : data wizard is now mostly functional

2004-03-03 05:30  staikos

	* : unnecessary

2004-03-02 04:21  staikos

	* : Trolltech: *PLEASE* add an option to designer to retain
	  compatibility with version X of Qt, or at least leave the old
	  designer version number in the .ui file. This gets tedious!

2004-03-02 04:09  staikos

	* : more of the wizard implemented

2004-03-02 03:24  staikos

	* : implement half of the wizard

2004-03-02 01:24  staikos

	* : here's the data wizard everyone is waiting for. Not integrated
	  yet.

2004-03-01 21:37  staikos

	* : 0.97-devel CVS_SILENT

2004-03-01 21:36  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-03-01 21:25  staikos

	* : crash fix

2004-03-01 20:53  staikos

	* : preparing 0.96 release

2004-03-01 18:10  arwalker

	* : Re-enabled the view scalars dialog...

2004-03-01 17:36  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings

2004-02-29 07:23  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-02-27 00:38  staikos

	* : reverting r1.50

2004-02-26 19:23  staikos

	* : don't allow creation of new filters if new ones don't exist

2004-02-23 06:07  staikos

	* : Wow that was a dumb bug :)

2004-02-23 02:49  staikos

	* : Finally track down a [seemingly longstanding] crash in the
	  plugin dialog when showing plugins that were already created.

2004-02-23 01:59  staikos

	* : introduce concept of orphan scalars and use it to make plugin
	  scalar saving work properly.

2004-02-18 21:19  staikos

	* : add tooltips with values of scalars

2004-02-16 23:27  netterfield

	* : Fix datamode bug.

2004-02-16 20:54  staikos

	* : misc fixes discovered today

2004-02-16 14:22  staikos

	* : disable the view scalars dialog for now - QTable is way too
	  expensive and delays startup time quite a bit. Let's come up with
	  a different solution.

2004-02-13 22:26  staikos

	* : some fixes and a few more tests

2004-02-13 22:18  staikos

	* : gcc2.95 compile fix

2004-02-13 22:18  staikos

	* : fix floating point scanning bug detected by regression suite

2004-02-13 22:10  staikos

	* : - added regression test for equations - fixed equation bugs in
	  dcop interface

2004-02-13 21:56  staikos

	* : force newer piolib

2004-02-13 21:53  staikos

	* : updates for API changes from Claude Mercier. Compile with old
	  piolib will now fail. Update to piolib-HEAD.

2004-02-13 21:30  staikos

	* : nearly forgot: don't leak!

2004-02-13 21:26  staikos

	* : don't re-optimize, reparse, etc when it's not necessary.

2004-02-13 20:04  staikos

	* : make it compile with newer gcc

2004-02-13 17:53  staikos

	* : removed this file

2004-02-13 17:52  staikos

	* : activate the new equation parser and interpreter. It's hooked in
	  inefficiently right now, and I have done very little regression
	  testing, but it seems to work well enough to start wide testing.
	  Timings indicate it is, finally, requiring approximately 1/4 the
	  amount of CPU time to evaluate the same equation as the old one,
	  on average. Regression tests to follow.

2004-02-13 11:40  staikos

	* : missed committing this file

2004-02-13 11:36  staikos

	* : implement more equation functionality including constants and
	  powers, and start adding optimizations (constant folding so far -
	  quite an improvement still!)

2004-02-12 17:59  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-02-12 17:56  staikos

	* : - much more work on the interpreter and parser - hook in a demo
	  with timings to demonstrate how much faster we are - interpret
	  most of the old functions result: new code, with function calls,
	  takes 1/3 the amount of CPU time as the old parser. In the absence
	  of function calls, the differential is much larger yet. Constant
	  folding and other optimizations could also be of use.

2004-02-12 15:52  staikos

	* : New KstEquation parser that should be many times faster than the
	  current one. Still needs a bit of work before it can be plugged
	  into KstEquation.

2004-02-12 05:46  staikos

	* : I just discovered how efficient Qt's XPM loading is

2004-02-12 04:50  staikos

	* : make this public just in case we want to call it from a script

2004-02-12 04:49  staikos

	* : create scalars before updating them

2004-02-12 04:45  staikos

	* : scalars should be updated in these cases

2004-02-12 04:44  staikos

	* : lots of important performance fixes, update fixes, and crash
	  avoidances

2004-02-12 03:45  staikos

	* : a bunch of optimizations and a couple of crash fixes

2004-02-11 18:34  staikos

	* : more unfortunate problems due to the event loop being re-entered
	  -> possible workaround would be to disable the update timer during
	  file loads, but file opening is asynchronous too!

2004-02-11 16:17  staikos

	* : scalar trigger creator dialog

2004-02-11 13:43  staikos

	* : make vectors accessible from js

2004-02-11 12:43  staikos

	* : make more sense, less crash

2004-02-11 12:03  staikos

	* : make it compile with newer piolib

2004-02-11 03:58  staikos

	* : - make _tag private and fixup accordingly - add the beginning of
	  vector and data object bindings for JS - mandatory TODO file

2004-02-11 02:45  staikos

	* : - Set the names of KstObjects so that they're more useful in JS
	  - Add a signal to KstScalar::setValue() so that it can be hooked
	  into for the purpose of triggering events on values - Add bindings
	  for KstScalars to the js code - Add a demo that shows how to
	  execute code when a scalar reaches a certain absolute value - Add
	  ability to load scripts from files (action merged with the UI) -
	  Merge in the right place

2004-02-10 17:47  staikos

	* : oops, don't set this if we don't have a complete piolib setup

2004-02-10 17:28  staikos

	* : This function was removed from piolib. Let's use a new one

2004-02-10 10:00  staikos

	* : renamed plancktoi->planckobj and TOI->Object to reflect the new
	  meaning of the class, which does all objects, not just TOI ones.
	  Could probably now remove the base class too.

2004-02-10 09:48  staikos

	* : Added "extension" framework to Kst which allows Kst to make use
	  of optional technology not available in the minimum required KDE
	  version. Added KJSEmbed extension, which is only marginally
	  functional right now, and is not in the build since it needs an
	  autoconf check still.

2004-02-09 13:42  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2004-02-09 13:42  staikos

	* : get rid of all the #ifdefs for piolib

2004-02-09 06:45  scripty

2004-02-07 00:59  arwalker

	* : fits_modify_vector_len( ) is not necessary and hampers
	  performance

2004-02-07 00:18  arwalker

	* : Modified code to recognize that a call to isspace( ... ) returns
	  true for the \n character.

2004-02-06 23:37  arwalker

	* : Cosmetic changes

2004-02-06 21:55  arwalker

	* : Ensure that iStatus is set to 0 before calling any cftisio
	  routines. Set the value for the number of elements to be read
	  correctly.

2004-02-06 19:30  arwalker

	* : Added dialog to display scalar values

2004-02-06 19:08  arwalker

	* : Another correction

2004-02-06 19:02  arwalker

	* : Use standard defines

	* : Ensure that KDE_CHECK_LIB correctly reports the presence of
	  cfitsio

2004-02-06 14:02  staikos

	* : compile without piolib

2004-02-06 08:06  mhunter

2004-02-05 23:11  arwalker

	* : Removed compiler warnings

2004-02-05 14:13  staikos

	* : Fix bug reported by Claude Mercier regarding unique name
	  detection not working in the vector dialog CCMAIL:
	  claude.mercier@ias.u-psud.fr

2004-02-05 06:05  staikos

	* : add an XML option for plugins and filters to request that they
	  be provided a local data pointer.

2004-02-05 05:43  staikos

	* : tab order fix

2004-02-05 05:39  staikos

	* : hack in auto completion on text changed - need to watch for
	  events to do this more cleanly.

2004-02-04 21:01  arwalker

	* : Added weighted and un-weighted sinusoid fits

2004-02-04 18:45  arwalker

	* : Typographical corrections

2004-02-04 18:18  arwalker

	* : Added exponential weighted and un-weighted fits

2004-02-04 16:30  staikos

	* : updates working

2004-02-04 16:19  staikos

	* : add updates support

2004-02-04 16:06  staikos

	* : make it generic - supports non-TOI too. Will rename the class
	  later, along with the filename

2004-02-04 15:35  staikos

	* : genericizing

2004-02-04 15:13  staikos

	* : administrative updates

2004-02-04 15:01  staikos

	* : finally sort out all the issues with this plugin. it no longer
	  loops forever, and can read partial or whole streams

2004-02-04 14:31  staikos

	* : making piolib plugin more correct, less crashy

2004-02-04 13:59  staikos

	* : why was this removed?

2004-02-04 12:48  staikos

	* : remove more dead code, make object reads very efficient (no data
	  copies or extra mallocs)

2004-02-04 11:02  staikos

	* : no longer needed

2004-02-04 11:01  staikos

	* : note needed

2004-02-04 11:00  staikos

	* : reworking more of the pio plugin

2004-02-04 10:36  staikos

	* : better debug messages from the data source loader, and start to
	  remold the piolib plugin (ironically going back in the direction
	  it originally began)

2004-02-04 07:48  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-02-04 01:39  arwalker

	* : Added weighted Gaussian and Lorentzian fits

	* : not entirely sure if this works yet, but get it compiling on
	  darwin

2004-01-31 20:24  staikos

	* : 0.96-devel

2004-01-31 20:00  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-01-31 19:56  staikos

	* : spec file updates

2004-01-31 19:26  staikos

	* : preparing v0.95

2004-01-30 19:42  arwalker

	* : Added absolute deviation, skewness, and kurtosis

2004-01-30 19:19  arwalker

	* : Gaussian fitting is now functional, in a framework which is
	  easily extended to other non-linear fits.

2004-01-30 14:03  netterfield

	* : Improve datamode - better rules for what 'closest pixel' means.
	  Some compiler warning fixes.

2004-01-30 01:00  arwalker

	* : Added

2004-01-30 00:59  arwalker

	* : Added non-linear fits

2004-01-30 00:58  arwalker

	* : Added first of nonlinear fits

2004-01-30 00:54  arwalker

	* : Added nonlinear fits

2004-01-29 19:12  arwalker

	* : Added conditional build for lfiio

2004-01-29 19:12  arwalker

	* : Added conditional build for lfiio datasource

2004-01-29 18:10  arwalker

	* : Modified to allow for conditional building of gsl dependent
	  plugins

2004-01-29 16:50  arwalker

	* : Added back linear interpolation after adding it to CVS.

2004-01-29 16:50  arwalker

	* : Added linear interpolation

2004-01-29 16:47  arwalker

	* : Removed obsolete file

2004-01-29 07:31  staikos

	* : build fix

2004-01-29 07:06  staikos

	* : update changelog

2004-01-29 06:39  staikos

	* : revert half the last change. it was incorrect

2004-01-29 01:47  staikos

	* : Make updates continue to work after zooming.

2004-01-29 01:26  staikos

	* : Sometimes I get too focused :)

2004-01-29 01:24  staikos

	* : only draw points that are inside the plot region

2004-01-29 00:20  arwalker

	* : Added interpolations

2004-01-28 05:17  staikos

	* : detabify CVS_SILENT

2004-01-28 05:05  staikos

	* : make updates for derived vectors work with a huge kludge

2004-01-28 04:49  netterfield

	* : Add getIndexNearX(x) to kstbasecurve, which looks for the index
	  near x. If the curve is monotonically rising, it uses a binary
	  search. Otherwise, it uses a linear search. Then use this function
	  to re-do dataMode.... It works - in that it does what I though I
	  wanted it to do...

2004-01-28 04:06  staikos

	* : return a sensible default label, as the function docs suggest ->
	  makes plot labels for filtered slave vectors work

2004-01-28 03:55  staikos

	* : did tied zoom ever work properly? This makes it zoom the proper
	  graphs

2004-01-28 03:47  staikos

	* : properly update the data manager on changes involving slave
	  vectors

2004-01-28 02:55  staikos

	* : build and install the plugin editor

2004-01-28 02:42  staikos

	* : add a basically untested autoconf check for gsl. The fits
	  plugins should use the variables set here instead of hardcoding
	  them, and those Makefiles should also be updated to reflect that
	  they are plugins and not libraries.

2004-01-28 02:29  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2004-01-28 02:26  staikos

	* : - plugins are modules, not libraries - fix warnings - fix
	  possible crashes in the plugin loader - cosmetic changes to the
	  manager - load plugins from system directories too, with
	  precedence given to user directories (should add XDG directories
	  later)

2004-01-27 22:51  staikos

	* : display arguments in the listbox to make it easier to work with

2004-01-27 06:54  staikos

	* : some polishing

2004-01-27 06:35  staikos

	* : The new filter parameter editor. Much nicer, and perhaps I'll
	  reuse this in the plugin dialog as well. It may still need some
	  cosmetic changes

2004-01-27 02:54  staikos

	* : Make datamode work on shifted vectors with an absolutely
	  disgusting hack that really should be removed ASAP.
	  SamplesPerFrame should be completely encapsulated within the

	* : Ensure that the vector select widgets are updated when a new

2004-01-20 21:09  arwalker

	* : Previously if the plugin dialog was open, with plugins

	  result in the vector lists being updated in the plugin dialog.
	  This has now been fixed.

2004-01-20 10:12  staikos

	* : As the previous implementation wasn't considered "close enough",
	  we now check the point rounded up and down (slight bias upward),
	  and use the shortest distance instead of the closest Y point. This
	  is closer to the concept of the "closest data point". It still
	  falls apart with very steep graphs. CCMAIL: 72204@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-13 01:36  netterfield

	* : Some UI Tweaks: -Use "settings->Configure Kst" to set colours
	  -Add Foreground colour to settings dialog -Remove colours from
	  plot dialog -Printed plots use same colors as screen. -Remove
	  'update rate' from plot dialog - it is in settings. -Make legends
	  use default (system) fonts, as the labels already do -Reformat
	  legend options in plot dialog -Reorder toolbar so plot-to-file is
	  nearer to print (needs new icon)

2004-01-11 19:36  arwalker

	* : Added border to the legend.

2004-01-10 07:05  arwalker

	* : Added options for user to place legend in front of plot. Added
	  options for foreground and background colors of legend. Removed
	  use of KstLabel in legend, as it was used only to provide symbol
	  processing, which it no longer does, and performance will be
	  better without it. Clean up of obsolete code.

2004-01-03 00:38  arwalker

	* : Provide better positioning of a text label after it has been
	  moved by a drag/drop operation. Also, draw the text properly in
	  the pixmap used during the drag operation, regardless of the text
	  justification used.

2004-01-02 21:42  arwalker

	* : Reinstate change that was removed by last commit.

2004-01-01 17:52  staikos

	* : revert whitespace changes

2003-12-31 22:44  arwalker

	* : As text labels can be rotated it does not make sense to use a
	  simple rectangle to define their bounding region, and this can
	  make it very difficult for a user to select an existing label. We
	  now use a region.

2003-12-31 22:36  arwalker

2003-12-31 18:41  staikos

	* : revert whitespace changes.

2003-12-31 18:13  arwalker

	* : Do not allow the size of the pixmap associated with a text label
	  to be increased in size during a drag operation else a partially
	  uninitialised pixmap will be drawn during the drag. This is only a
	  problem when the size of one of the dimensions of the label is
	  greater than the corresponding screen size.

2003-12-30 08:53  adridg

	* : Need time.h (explicitly on FBSD) for struct timeval. There's the
	  whole HAVE_SYS_TIME_H thing that ought to be done around the
	  include, but I can't see anyone else doing it in keg-[12].

2003-12-29 23:34  arwalker

	* : Modified behaviour of ^ and _ with symbol (greek) characters

2003-12-29 22:26  arwalker

	* : Instead of drawing a label to the screen character by character
	  it is now drawn only with each font attribute (size, emphasis,
	  etc.) change.

	* : Add categories, patch by Frans Englich

2003-12-24 01:48  staikos

	* : add filter to the menu, enhance the dcop interface (add some
	  filter support)

2003-12-23 05:53  staikos

	* : Add copy action that copies the current data point to the
	  clipboard (but not the selection). In data mode, it uses the data
	  mode point. returns (NAN,NAN) when there is no current point.
	  Eventually it should provide a native mimetype too.

2003-12-23 05:34  staikos

	* : Oh dear, did he really try to draw another icon? Yes, yes he
	  did. Clearly needs to be replaced by someone who knows how to

2003-12-21 06:20  staikos

	* : rvectors should not crash if they cannot find the file they
	  need. It's not pretty, but I would rather have null files than
	  have files that are useless in all ways except that they are not
	  null. Meanwhile we shouldn't return null files for dirfiles that
	  don't exist yet. That will be fixed next. CCMAIL:
	  70923-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-12-21 05:22  staikos

	* : Make scalars work by name, and make the filter create a scalar
	  with a given name if it is specified but it doesn't exist. This
	  may not be ideal but it's the most convenient implementation right
	  now. For some reason when scalars are changed for a plugin, the
	  plugin doesn't update.

2003-12-21 03:41  staikos

	* : We really need a solution for this in designer. Everytime I
	  commit a .ui file I have to remember to edit it by hand first and

2003-12-21 03:33  staikos

2003-12-20 05:10  staikos

	* : revert last

2003-12-20 05:00  staikos

	* : Make filters work in the case of a filterset with exactly 1
	  filter defined, and only constants for the input scalars. Fixes to
	  follow, including save support. Also seems that a bug in gcc
	  3.3-prerelease (suse) was tripped by this code, but I was unable
	  to make a good testcase so far. Worked around until more can be
	  determined.

2003-12-19 23:39  arwalker

	* : Should have checked this in for the original fix.

2003-12-19 23:16  arwalker

	* : Redraw the point selection combobox after the dialog is
	  initially drawn, so the geometry is correct.

2003-12-19 22:47  arwalker

	* : As the histogram will draw lines regardless of the user
	  selection we simply disable the option and always select it. This
	  avoids potential user confusion.

2003-12-19 14:17  staikos

	* : filters are almost functional right now. just a few small FIXMEs
	  to go...

2003-12-19 11:29  staikos

2003-11-07 21:01  staikos

	* : This is 0.94

2003-11-07 13:43  staikos

	* : - fixed d2asc - needs KInstance now - equations now get escaped
	  for XML writeout - we should consider writing out with QDom
	  instead

2003-11-07 13:21  staikos

	* : discovered and worked around the reason for crashes - the
	  regression test was generating orphan vectors, and issue
	  unresolved in the DCOP interface since it's so useful to be able
	  to do, but completely unhandled in file handling and data
	  management

2003-11-07 06:30  scripty

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2003-11-06 14:18  netterfield

	* : Fix for Bug 67371

2003-11-06 02:55  staikos

	* : Implement more DCOP calls (file manipulation), and more
	  testcases

2003-11-05 22:33  staikos

	* : more regression tests

2003-11-05 22:13  staikos

	* : Allow the reading of vectors from files via DCOP

2003-11-05 09:17  coolo

	* : it might come as a suprise to the one or the other, but you
	  can't simply set the name of the module 4 times and then it will
	  magically know what to do.

2003-11-05 06:47  staikos

	* : - fix saving of kstfiles - allow - for stdin

2003-11-05 04:35  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2003-11-05 04:33  staikos

2003-11-05 03:50  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2003-11-05 03:49  staikos

	* : Implement reload support. Unfortunately it is not nearly as
	  efficient as I would prefer to see it. It also results in rvectors
	  detaching from shared data sources (fragmenting).

2003-11-05 00:06  staikos

	* : update the spec file for the plugins, add the stub for the
	  reload action

2003-11-04 06:15  staikos

	* : default to an existing vector if there is one instead of
	  generating a new X vector

2003-10-31 23:58  staikos

	* : no need to complete stdin

2003-10-31 23:53  staikos

	* : Added stdin support, fixed a couple of buglets. Autocompletion
	  population still needs to be fixed because it conflicts with the
	  stdin plugin now.

2003-10-31 20:55  staikos

	* : Hack up piolib to make it barely functional with TOI objects for
	  now. Needs many changes still though

2003-10-31 14:17  staikos

2003-10-24 06:01  staikos

	* : add planck file detection. The new method is that in order to
	  access planck data, the user must provide the xml filename. The
	  vectors are then considered to be a group and an object.

2003-10-24 05:13  staikos

	* : for now, let's do it like this

2003-10-24 05:07  staikos

	* : fixed the XML

2003-10-24 05:01  staikos

	* : The start of a tool to view and manipulate planck xml files

2003-10-24 02:00  staikos

	* : test stuff for pio

2003-10-23 23:31  staikos

	* : Implement auto completion immediately. CCMAIL:
	  64893-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-10-23 21:09  staikos

	* : Well the dirfile plugin passes initial testing with this patch.

2003-10-23 18:38  staikos

	* : fix validity check. Indirect files are confirmed working now

2003-10-23 00:55  staikos

	* : fix linkage

2003-10-23 00:37  staikos

	* : merging the planckio branch and creating the framework for the
	  planck plugin

2003-10-22 23:46  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT update changelog

2003-10-22 23:12  staikos

	* : - Implement indirect datasource as a plugin which contains
	  another datasource! - merge some more of kstfile - including
	  dirfile and frame file detection - remove unused methods - make
	  isValid() virtual for the indirect datasource plugin

2003-10-22 20:48  

	* : This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to accommodate a
	  server-side copy/move.

2003-10-22 02:32  staikos

	* : - get rid of C++ compatibility headers, they're not needed now -
	  fix dirfile plugin build and enable it - it certainly doesn't work
	  yet though.

2003-10-22 02:08  staikos

	* : - pushed some functionality from the plugins up into the base
	  class - added the beginning (uncompilable) of the dirfile plugin

2003-10-22 01:06  staikos

	* : Nothing wrong with an empty file - it could get data later if
	  it's generated in realtime

2003-10-22 00:00  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT remove unneeded debug and update changelog

2003-10-21 23:43  staikos

	* : Activated the new plugin code. kstfile is now obsolete. NOTE:
	  Only ascii files work now, and I would prefer to write that as
	  "work". The demo loads and seems to be minimally functional. There
	  is still much work left to do though. Other plugins will be
	  reimplemented over time. If you need stable Kst, please update
	  from the kst_0_93_release tag.

2003-10-21 02:52  staikos

	* : ascii plugin is nearly done, but still completely untested

2003-10-21 01:18  staikos

	* : Don't leave invalid vectors in the list to be updated from.
	  CCMAIL: 66303-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-10-20 09:37  staikos

	* : *finally* straighten out the log-log graph coordinates in data
	  mode. I think this is the last data mode bug to fix before 0.93

2003-10-20 08:56  staikos

	* : - Only display data in data mode when we are actually inside a
	  graph - Init some variables - Point out optimization points in the
	  curve and vector code

2003-10-17 07:56  staikos

	* : tab order fixes

2003-10-17 07:34  staikos

	* : added ChangeLog and makefile target to generate it with
	  cvs2cl.pl

2003-10-17 07:29  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2003-10-17 07:23  staikos

	* : - install the datasource header and its dependencies - note in
	  those classes about binary compatibility - move KstObject
	  implementations out of the header file - add virtual_hooks - add
	  d-pointers - create datasource plugin template - create ascii
	  plugin that is completely non-functional right now Plugins may
	  change quite a bit still

2003-10-17 06:40  staikos

	* : let's query the opposite way

2003-10-17 06:23  staikos

	* : more datasource code implemented

2003-10-17 04:10  staikos

	* : started the abstract data source object

2003-10-17 02:53  staikos

	* : minor changes - mostly whitespace and dead code removal - from
	  planck branch primarily

2003-10-10 07:37  staikos

	* : crash fix

2003-10-10 03:09  staikos

	* : apply crash fix from the branch into HEAD

2003-10-03 08:26  staikos

	* : decrease instantiation time of KstApp::KstApp by 20%

2003-10-03 04:46  staikos

	* : statistical optimisations in the ascii file reading code - check
	  the common case before the uncommon case.

2003-10-03 01:31  staikos

	* : huge improvements in drawing performance - extremely noticeable.
	  drawing should now be about 7 times faster. I can still improve
	  this by a factor of 4 or so from where it is now by rewriting this
	  code altogether. other slow points are documented.

2003-10-03 00:14  staikos

	* : get rid of unnecessary isnan() calls. cachegrind seems to
	  indicate that they are at least as expensive as floor() and we
	  call it too often (hundreds of thousands of times)

2003-10-02 21:59  staikos

	* : PSD optimizations: store iterators or pointers to avoid extra
	  lookups. Should reduce cpu time on some inner loops by as much as
	  78% according to cachegrind!

2003-10-02 10:55  staikos

	* : Early results from profiling: - cache the label width where
	  possible to avoid recalculation (very expensive) - don't update
	  dialogs that aren't shown() - cache the font families

2003-10-02 09:20  staikos

	* : more enabled/disabled fixes

2003-10-02 07:14  staikos

	* : fix datamanager button synchronization

2003-10-02 05:52  staikos

	* : Allow the removal of error bars CCMAIL: 65340-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-10-02 05:02  staikos

	* : This was the result of a misguided patch. Unfortunately KstMouse
	  will make it overly complicated to add more mouse modes in the
	  future due to its concept of "plotNum". It might be a good idea to
	  store more stateful information, and actually have the plotNum
	  reflect the plot it's actually in. I think this could simplify
	  KstView somewhat too. Anyways, something to think about for the
	  future. CCMAIL: 65278-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-30 23:57  staikos

	* : can't use a fixed widget here with datamode anymore. this now
	  flickers but ideally we can fix this later with a more custom
	  widget.

2003-09-30 01:17  staikos

	* : Implement the rest of #64894. There is still room for
	  improvement (right now it only handles integral x coordinates,
	  it's probably not the most efficient, etc), but it works. CCMAIL:
	  64894-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-29 21:07  staikos

	* : Add support for most of #64894. It's not functional, but this
	  removes much of the code duplication in kstview and adds a stub
	  "data mode" to be filled in later. Might require some minor
	  semantic changes to kstbasecurve and/or kstplot. CCMAIL:
	  64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-27 22:41  staikos

	* : Most of the implementation require for this feature. Requires
	  more design in order to complete. CCMAIL: 64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-26 23:22  staikos

	* : On second thought, better be safe.

2003-09-26 23:21  staikos

	* : This seems to update the mouse properly. CCMAIL:
	  64891-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-26 22:33  staikos

	* : Simple script to generate data in real time for testing

2003-09-26 13:40  staikos

	* : Ah this could be the reason. Does this patch help? CCMAIL:
	  64977@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 21:49  netterfield

	* : Fix Bug 64890 - Zoomed graphs give wrong mouse data Add a new
	  (experimental) autoscale mode: spike insensitive autoscale During
	  a balloon flight, the telemtered data often has spikes and
	  dropouts. I have added an autoscale mode which ignores points near
	  unusually large transients. kstvector calculates the limits,
	  ns_min and ns_max. It seems to work very well on archived data.

2003-09-25 20:29  staikos

	* : more notes

2003-09-25 19:55  staikos

	* : Fix the KstFile disappearance. Also update the data manager and
	  other dialogs when changes are made directly on the plot.

2003-09-25 17:26  staikos

	* : lrint() not portable enough. rint() should be sufficient here
	  anyways. CCMAIL: 64926-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 08:54  staikos

	* : I can't find an argument either way for this, so let's select
	  all if the user wants it. CCMAIL: 64892-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 00:53  staikos

	* : Changes default rate from 60.0 Hz -> 100 Hz Thanks for the fix.
	  CCMAIL: 64888-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-24 18:06  staikos

	* : open 0.93 development and remove a spurious semicolon

2003-09-24 17:59  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT bump version and retag

2003-09-24 04:18  staikos

2003-09-21 20:45  staikos

	* : wow this was tricky to find. Update the plot number in the mouse
	  class so that the proper labels are searched in label mode. This
	  might need to be expanded but I haven't triggered such bugs
	  elsewhere yet.

2003-09-21 11:52  netterfield

	* : bugfix for d2asc

2003-09-20 20:20  staikos

	* : This isn't necessary

2003-09-20 20:06  staikos

	* : Add "Edit Curve" to the context menu to quickly edit a curve in
	  a plot. Fix some minor label mode bugs.

2003-09-20 19:39  binner

	* : CVS_SILENT spelling fixes

2003-09-20 19:11  staikos

	* : context menu reorganised. it's not so overwhelming now, and
	  shortforms were all expanded (Prev->Previous, etc)

2003-09-20 18:14  netterfield

	* : Plot dialog needs to be updated after the plot is selected...
	  (related to "Plot/Label selection bug)

2003-09-20 18:04  staikos

	* : Make the plot label dialog work properly and some minor cleanups

2003-09-20 15:04  netterfield

	* : Fixed "Exiting Bug"

2003-09-20 14:03  netterfield

	* : Add License and copyright stuff to the c files

2003-09-20 13:34  netterfield

	* : Vector field name autocompletion in vector dialog and quick
	  curves dialog (only works for dirfile files. Ascii files it
	  doesn't make sense - just a collumn number, and readdata files are
	  obsolete, and no longer to be updated)

2003-09-20 06:46  staikos

	* : various bugfixes for labels, the view, and mouse handling
	  enhance the context menu to allow the user to easily add and
	  remove curves and delete plots

2003-09-18 01:31  staikos

	* : fixlets and exposing a function for use in datapush

2003-09-17 20:36  staikos

	* : minor bug fix

2003-09-16 01:40  staikos

	* : fix various label drag issues as discussed on the list,
	  including: - labels may only be dragged in label mode - labels may
	  be editted and deleted again

2003-09-15 16:51  netterfield

	* : Common Case speedup: redraw of large vectors after zooming

2003-09-12 22:54  staikos

	* : fix painting and add a small fudge factor to get the label to
	  fall in the "exact" right place without any offset

2003-09-12 22:00  staikos

	* : minor glitch fixes and polishing for label drags drags now work
	  quite well I think

2003-09-12 21:49  staikos

	* : hotspot changes as discussed - labels now drag from the point
	  selected and drop exactly where they appear to be dropping.

2003-09-12 02:37  staikos

	* : eliminate the garbage in the drag pixmap. Unfortunately it still
	  doesn't paint into the pixmap properly so we get a blank pixmap,
	  or a pixmap with tiny writing in it now. Will have to debug this
	  later.

2003-09-12 02:24  staikos

	* : cleanups, and fix drag initiation detection. Drag is re-enabled
	  in non-label mode to see how the interaction is (and see if it
	  should be left in or reverted). It seems to work well for me but
	  it may or may not be unexpected/interfere with zooming. It is
	  however convenient.

2003-09-12 01:53  staikos

	* : only allow label drags in label mode for now. proper drag start
	  should be added later to avoid the problem of zoombox initiating a
	  drag.

2003-09-12 01:47  staikos

	* : draggable labels - basically works, but still a bit buggy
	  problems: - the drag pixmap gets corrupted somehow - dragging to
	  other plots causes the extents to be temporarily broken - the
	  pixmap is centred around the hotspot, but drawn (top,left) at the
	  hotspot after the drop. (which should we change?)

2003-09-11 23:10  staikos

	* : A whackload of minor/insignificant cleanups, and make the label
	  dialog clear out the entry field when creating new labels in order
	  to distinguish from the case where the user clicked on an existing
	  label in order to edit it. This is particularily important for
	  cases where the user clicks close to an existing label but
	  accidentally misses it.

2003-09-11 22:31  staikos

	* : put a title on the context menu

2003-09-11 22:17  staikos

	* : Shift and Ctrl should not override label mode

2003-09-11 22:07  staikos

	* : Lots of code cleanup, and make the mouse pointer an arrow over
	  labels (the existing code was incorrect)

2003-09-11 21:13  staikos

	* : Add the rest of the context menu stuff requested in the TODO

2003-09-11 19:04  staikos

	* : Create the context menu requested in the TODO file. Added "Edit"
	  and "Delete" so far. Still need to add the more advanced items.

2003-09-01 13:41  staikos

	* : revert last. kst must compile with 3.1 also.

2003-09-01 13:19  tokoe

2003-08-13 07:02  staikos

	* : parser for the format file, and return a list of all the
	  filenames

2003-08-13 06:34  staikos

	* : heavy reworkings: - make the socket reusable - make the
	  connection state two phased: - first phase is control and setup -
	  second phase is passive pull mode - "go" triggers a move from
	  phase one to phase two - "format" in phase one dumps the format
	  file - prepare to parse the format file

2003-08-12 22:42  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2003-08-12 22:39  staikos

	* : - Makefile for datapushd - Hack for printing empty files to

2003-08-12 08:21  staikos

	* : some bugfixes and a quite command

2003-08-12 08:04  staikos

	* : the server portion of the code to monitor a datafile and push
	  changes over the lan

2003-08-11 16:24  mueller

	* : fix compilation

2003-08-11 01:34  staikos

	* : don't wipe out the entry fields if the plugin manager is opened

2003-08-11 00:45  staikos

	* : more GUI cleanups

2003-08-10 20:52  staikos

	* : UI enhancements (part 1)

2003-08-10 20:38  staikos

	* : Convert vectors to using a map. It's still not what I would
	  consider 'clean' because we don't use this everywhere yet. Infact,
	  there are cases that still using private members instead of the
	  input lists for their vectors. This is purely for performance
	  reasons. There is no harm now because we don't even use the input
	  lists for anything externally, but we might in the future. For
	  now, all is good. Also fixes some crashes I stumbled across. More
	  uncovered bug fixes to follow.

2003-08-08 20:01  staikos

	* : after a marathon regression testing, valgrinding, and debugging,
	  I think I can safely say that the list->map conversion of scalar
	  inputs and outputs works and vector conversion can be done too.

2003-08-07 19:22  staikos

	* : remove scalarlist.h - not needed

2003-08-07 18:52  staikos

	* : - fix a memory corruption problem in main due to double delete
	  of the mainwindow in some cases - only update the necessary parts
	  of the data manager. this is implemented in a rather slow way (the
	  code is ~O(n^2)) but it is more reliable for now. In the future we
	  should tell the datamanager what to do, as opposed to telling it
	  to update and having it determine what needs to be updated.

2003-08-06 01:33  staikos

	* : by default, zero memory on resize(). uses memset() for now, but
	  an alternative method is also provided.

2003-08-06 00:58  staikos

	* : We decided that this is the proper output for the test.

2003-07-30 05:18  staikos

	* : notes about what remains CVS_SILENT

2003-07-30 05:04  staikos

	* : Plenty of updates to the test suite. Now generates plots and
	  output. Fixed a couple of minor bugs from before, and added option
	  -v to specify to run Kst inside valgrind. Latest results: -
	  valgrind clean except for UMRs when accessing unset data inside
	  vectors (not so bad, still not sure what to do) - printing empty
	  plots fails (KPrinter mode)

2003-07-30 04:57  staikos

	* : fix another crash found by regression tests, and implement
	  printing images and postscript from dcop. Seems to have trouble
	  with printing empty plots in postscript, though printing empty
	  plots to images works. Could indicate a bug in the printing code.

2003-07-30 04:10  staikos

	* : fix testcases 169,170,172,174 and put in a compiled-out solution
	  idea for testcases 190,191

2003-07-30 01:54  staikos

	* : a regression test script for Kst. So far it seems to trigger
	  approximately half a dozen bugs.

2003-07-30 00:58  staikos

	* : traced down a UMR, and a nasty bug that was resulting in complex
	  crashes: main() is far too complex. It should do much less, or be
	  refactored. The problem is that there are too many codepaths, and
	  KstApp* was not being deleted, resulting in kstdoc not being
	  deleted, resulting in the global lists being nonempty (and the
	  static destruction trying to empty them, of course in the wrong
	  order!). (this was found with the new regression testing scripts)

2003-07-27 13:18  mueller

	* : compile (gcc 3.4+)

2003-07-26 02:58  netterfield

	* : Fix minor math error

2003-07-22 20:37  staikos

	* : add ability to create vector curves, and fix plot creation
	  slightly (it's still a bit broken in that the newly created plots
	  seem to take over the screen until the plotlist is manipulated
	  again. will track this down later.)

2003-07-22 20:02  staikos

	* : plot manipulation functions exposed to dcop. can create, delete,
	  list, and list contents of plots. can also add and remove curves.
	  extended plot manipulation is still missing.

2003-07-22 16:30  staikos

	* : vector manipulation dcop interface, and scalar creation support

2003-07-22 15:58  staikos

	* : many new dcop methods added, and scalars can now be set by
	  assignment of a double. It's now possible to generate equation
	  plots of all sorts with dcop, manipulate scalars, generate
	  vectors, list vectors, list objects, list scalars, list inputs and
	  outputs, save vectors, and more!

2003-07-21 18:07  staikos

	* : vector saving is complete, including progress dialog and error
	  messages

2003-07-18 22:32  staikos

	* : Allow vectors to be saved to disk. UI doesn't keep sync with the
	  vector list at all times yet (needs at least one fix still), and
	  there is no error reporting in the saving code yet. Also might
	  switch the vector saving code to use QTextStream instead of
	  snprintf+write.

2003-07-18 20:34  staikos

	* : bump version number to indicate post 0.91, add code for saving
	  vectors (unused). Also fill in the about data some.

2003-07-17 23:38  staikos

	* : spec file fixes

2003-07-17 22:43  staikos

	* : notes about how to make a Kst release (packaging)

2003-07-17 22:10  staikos

	* : bump version number CVS_SILENT

2003-07-17 16:28  netterfield

	* : Possibly reduce non noac nsf mounted dirfile concurrency
	  pathologies

2003-07-17 15:15  staikos

	* : make sure all objects are updated (equations, plugins
	  especially)

2003-07-16 23:47  staikos

	* : untested spec file for kst, also updated the lsm a bit

2003-07-16 13:17  netterfield

	* : Pause updates while mouse zooming deleted obsolete static Should
	  be ready for 0.90 'release'.

2003-07-16 01:34  netterfield

	* : Stick with ~clean interpolation with bounds checking.

2003-07-15 23:17  staikos

	* : don't jump around in the dialogs when an update(-1) is
	  triggered. this is a bit of a hack, but it works flawlessly so far
	  and it's safer than changing the logic of update() everywhere.

2003-07-15 23:05  staikos

	* : drop the references before updating the plot dialog

2003-07-15 22:46  staikos

	* : minor cleanups in the plot dialog, and put some assert()s and
	  remove some unneeded stuff in kstvector::interpolate

2003-07-15 21:08  staikos

	* : fix the ref counting in the plot dialog

2003-07-15 20:58  netterfield

	* : Use local variables for math in kstvector::update. 84% cpu to
	  30% cpu in one benchmark....

2003-07-15 20:31  staikos

	* : refcounting fixes, and disable delete in the dialogs when it is
	  not usable.

2003-07-15 19:44  staikos

	* : don't access elements of the list that don't exist

2003-07-15 19:21  staikos

	* : - fix equations which were rather broken - fix a c&p copyright
	  that was never editted

2003-07-15 18:54  netterfield

	* : Adjustable update delay in the plot dialog. Is saved in kst file
	  as well.

2003-07-15 18:20  staikos

	* : - remove some unused stuff from kstequationcurve - make
	  kstvector explicitly ref count to be safe

2003-07-15 18:10  staikos

	* : switch to using a QDict for scalars, and make sure they are
	  cleaned up when the parent vector is done with them. Unfortunately
	  QDict<KSharedPtr<foo> > doesn't seem to work too well so this may
	  not last.

2003-07-15 16:00  netterfield

	* : CPU usage bug in kstrvector fixed rework menues

2003-07-15 14:40  staikos

	* : various minor bugfixes, as well as making scalars and vectors
	  use the same namespace.

2003-07-15 13:19  staikos

	* : The final ref counting bugs that I could find.

2003-07-15 12:43  staikos

	* : more cleanups, vector removal works

2003-07-15 12:13  staikos

	* : store data object names

2003-07-15 01:03  staikos

	* : some cleanups, comments, and movements

2003-07-15 00:44  staikos

	* : -very- close to perfect ref counting (and thus working purging)
	  now. the only remaining problem is that the data manager doesn't
	  display the ref count for vectors quite correctly.

2003-07-15 00:40  staikos

	* : almost there - only a few extra references are hanging around
	  now!

2003-07-15 00:08  staikos

	* : - repair the previous commit - remove more stored curve lists.
	  the hide() trick doesn't work for obvious reasons

2003-07-14 23:47  staikos

	* : clean some sprintf()

2003-07-14 23:35  staikos

	* : some ref counting fixes, with purge of objects enabled. still
	  more to be done.

2003-07-14 22:48  staikos

	* : - plot dialog doesn't need to keep the curve list around -
	  update the data manager last - don't access the empty combobox in
	  the curve placement widget

2003-07-14 16:00  netterfield

	* : Vector and Rvector work -fixed interpolation bugs -only the
	  first sample in the last frame is read to make interplation with
	  coarser vectors make sense -refactored some stuff in RVector - use
	  Vector methods more

2003-07-11 18:09  staikos

	* : cleanup some unused stuff

2003-07-11 18:00  staikos

	* : port data vectors to the new listview, and clean up after a
	  visit from the const police

2003-07-11 17:35  staikos

	* : deleting some types of objects works now (those ones also have
	  proper usage counts)

2003-07-11 07:44  staikos

	* : Kst provides its own palette now, and use KPalette in
	  kstcolorsequence.

2003-07-11 07:02  staikos

	* : palette file with the Kst colours

2003-07-11 00:20  netterfield

	* : psd's use output vectors instead of locally allocated arrays
	  output vectors now work from psd's fixed 1 off bug in
	  kstvector::interpolate()

2003-07-10 09:43  staikos

	* : some work towards getting the usage counts back in sync

2003-07-10 08:53  staikos

	* : - usage note for kstplugin - only activate Edit and Delete
	  buttons when they're meaningful

2003-07-10 08:41  staikos

	* : lots of cleanup, bug fixing, and error handling. This stuff can
	  now handle all kinds of crazy errors like invalid input files, and
	  recover with as much information as possible. For instance, it's
	  now possible to load a plugin with invalid input or no output
	  vectors defined and it will notify the user, mark the plugin, and
	  wait for it to be repaired.

2003-07-09 18:22  staikos

	* : lazy load input vectors

2003-07-09 12:50  netterfield

	* : Fix modality bug in label dialog Fix compilation bugs with
	  --enable-final

2003-07-07 21:51  staikos

	* : add licence and copyright (as best as could be determined)
	  Barth: you might want to change the years on some of these if you
	  care about that. I just put a generic copyright in place for now.

2003-07-07 21:27  staikos

	* : fix bug: error bars were inverted - set none, it tries to use
	  *end(). set one and it wipes out your setting add license and
	  copyright

2003-07-07 20:58  staikos

	* : - use a static deleter - convert the rest of the color stuff
	  that I could find to use KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 20:36  staikos

	* : convert to KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 20:27  staikos

	* : re-add the color changer. Could use some enhancement by the
	  artistically endowed. Right now it has the old color list and uses
	  those, along with the QColor::dark() versions of those colors.

2003-07-07 19:01  staikos

	* : allow Escape to break out of a zoom

2003-07-07 18:41  netterfield

	* : Fix bug in psd's some progress on real time dirfile vector
	  reading... dirfiles are separate files for each field. They may
	  not appear sycronously over NFS unless mounted -o noac.

2003-07-07 18:07  staikos

	* : just return garbage instead of crashing

2003-07-07 17:42  staikos

	* : explain to the user why we are about to crash with an absolutely
	  baffling backtrace

2003-07-07 15:57  staikos

	* : urgh this stuff is just too inconsistent in kdelibs :( Let's be
	  explicit and manually do what we want in each case.

2003-07-07 13:50  netterfield

	* : Usable arbitrary labels (need UI feedback now) Fixed vector
	  problems: -changing rvector ranges now works -fixed sigma and rms
	  scalars

2003-07-07 07:36  staikos

	* : workaround for kmainwindow problem

2003-07-07 00:53  staikos

	* : slightly improve the hack and apply it to the statusbar too

2003-07-07 00:13  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT warn--

2003-07-07 00:10  staikos

	* : keep the toolbar action status in sync when restoring with
	  session management. Is this a kdelibs bug? It seems to me that
	  this should be automatic.

2003-07-05 20:41  netterfield

	* : Label saving, use scalarwidget in labeldialog.

2003-07-05 00:51  staikos

	* : don't crash

2003-07-04 16:34  netterfield

	* : added Saving/loading arbitrary labels.

2003-07-04 15:53  netterfield

	* : More work on labels: -label editing works -mouse cursor
	  indicates when you are over an editable label

2003-07-03 22:55  staikos

	* : an example of lazy loading input vectors

2003-07-03 21:59  staikos

	* : cleanup loads of warnings

2003-07-03 13:26  staikos

	* : fix connection

2003-06-29 21:29  sleiber

	* : Fix text

2003-06-29 20:31  mlaurent

	* : ";;" -> ";"

2003-06-28 16:15  sleiber

	* : add a caption to the printingdialog

2003-06-28 14:07  netterfield

	* : label selection in process...

2003-06-28 11:29  mueller

	* : speling fixes

2003-06-27 17:54  staikos

	* : compile with kdelibs 3.1.x

2003-06-27 06:29  staikos

	* : setEnabled/Disabled cleanups

2003-06-27 06:24  staikos

	* : KIO enable image saving

2003-06-27 05:28  staikos

	* : completely rework the graphics file dialog. Uses KURLRequester
	  now, supports KImageIO, and is far less code in general. Still
	  needs to be KIO enabled.

2003-06-26 06:04  staikos

	* : graphics.ui is unused, and fix the layouts on graphfiledialog a
	  bit

2003-06-26 06:00  staikos

	* : - use scalarselector in eqdialog, and fix a small bug in scalar
	  selector - allow doubleclick in the data manager to bring up the
	  editor dialog

2003-06-26 05:48  staikos

	* : Make sure Apply Edits is the default button on the dialogs. Also
	  get vector lists with <None> working in the vector selector. Works
	  in the curve dialog now.

2003-06-26 05:30  staikos

	* : leak fixes, and add <None> vector to the vectorselector

2003-06-26 00:47  staikos

	* : layout fix for plugin dialog, as well as a bug fix. minor fixes
	  to the scalar selector, including a double validator.

2003-06-26 00:29  staikos

	* : add the scalar selector, which uses the scalar editor. Integrate
	  it with the plugin dialog to start. Also bugfixes in the plugin
	  dialog, and in the vector selector.

2003-06-25 22:46  staikos

	* : The rest of the data manager dialogs use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 22:23  staikos

	* : Use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 22:08  staikos

	* : switch to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 21:40  staikos

	* : Add the vector selector widget, along with implementing it in
	  the equation dialog. Seems quite useful so far. Also cleanup the
	  vector dialog a bit. Also fix that annoying bug where it wouldn't
	  display on startup. Unfortunately it's nothing more than a hack,
	  really.

2003-06-25 19:39  staikos

	* : a scalar editor dialog for creating custom scalars. presently
	  unused. the idea is to go from comboboxes or lineedits to actually
	  having a kstvectorselector and a kstscalarselector, with a creator
	  button where applicable.

2003-06-25 15:37  staikos

	* : copy in the backup file code

2003-06-25 13:33  staikos

	* : not in 3.1 I guess

2003-06-25 04:29  staikos

	* : remove some code that has lost its usefulness

2003-06-25 04:25  staikos

	* : vector dialog now uses globalInstance(). Reconnect it to hs, psd
	  and curve dialogs as it was before.

2003-06-25 03:49  staikos

	* : A whole bunch of refactoring. DataObjects now have a
	  showDialog() method which if implemented will show the proper
	  dialog for that object. KstApp no long needs to store
	  eq/plugin/hs/psd/curve dialogs. Others may follow. There is also
	  no need to do type identification on the object to determine which
	  dialog to show it in. Dialogs now may emit "modified" to update
	  kstdoc. Pointer to KstDoc in dialogs is now deprecated, and
	  hopefully will be fully eliminated in the future.

2003-06-25 01:28  staikos

	* : - clean up our slave vectors and scalars when data objects are
	  deleted. - clean up KstFiles when RVectors are removed - start to
	  add Purge code, but it doesn't seem to work right. I think there
	  are still stale references to objects around. At least it won't
	  crash now, but cleaning up just doesn't work right yet.

2003-06-25 00:43  staikos

	* : 1) I somehow reverted my fix, so restore it: must add to
	  existing plots before adding new ones otherwise the combobox gets
	  desynced. 2) rework the plugin handling a bit - should work better
	  now 3) don't allow vectors/scalars to be created with existing
	  labels 4) vectors/scalars created with blank tag get one
	  automatically assigned.

2003-06-24 20:03  staikos

	* : HOWTO write plugins

2003-06-24 19:29  staikos

	* : revert a small part of the last patch, and add backup file
	  support

2003-06-24 19:18  staikos

	* : session management works now

2003-06-24 17:05  coolo

	* : fixes

2003-06-23 21:25  staikos

	* : make it clear that there is no typo

2003-06-22 19:15  mueller

	* : speling fixes

2003-06-21 20:31  deller

	* : some cleanups and roaming user fixes: use
	  readPathEntry/writePathEntry instead of readEntry/writeEntry where
	  necessary

2003-06-21 04:21  netterfield

	* : Removed doc dependency from dialogs - use signals. Fix hang bug
	  in quick psd dialog Fix nan/infinity bug in kstvector.

2003-06-20 22:52  staikos

	* : beginnings of session code, not done though.

2003-06-20 20:14  staikos

	* : Let kmainwindow store the toolbar/size/etc settings for us

2003-06-20 18:54  staikos

	* : factor out more addPlot() code

2003-06-20 18:41  staikos

	* : wipe out another copy of addPlot()

2003-06-20 18:37  staikos

	* : enable placement in psds, and refactor addPlot as well as make
	  it more generally useful and robust

2003-06-20 17:49  staikos

	* : moc doesn't like variables in the slots section

2003-06-20 17:47  staikos

	* : bye bye quick equations. they can now be done from the equation
	  dialog, or via dcop. Also added a routine to create vectors via
	  dcop. However it makes regular vectors which are therefore
	  orphans. If we decide that this is useful, I guess we should make
	  a governor/owner for these things. In any case, it's useful for
	  testing purposes right now.

2003-06-20 17:32  staikos

	* : set correct values for the vector's scalars

2003-06-20 17:17  staikos

	* : make eqdialog have a curve placement widget and use it. refactor
	  a bit, with much more to come. a bit more dialog cleanup in place
	  also. Unfortunately there is a bug in eqdialog that makes the plot
	  not use the proper coordinates to display with when creating a new
	  plot. I'll have to try to track this down later. kstvector now has
	  a method to generate a vector - this didn't belong in
	  kstequationcurve.

2003-06-20 14:11  netterfield

	* : Limited functionality Arbitrary lables. (Not editable) Bug fix
	  in kstplotdialog_i some signal re-working

2003-06-20 05:48  staikos

	* : - add a demo dcop interface. has methods to list the scalars,
	  list the vectors, create an equation plot (basic, slightly
	  incomplete, but usable), and show the data manager dialog - add a
	  method to kstobjectlist to generate a list of the tagnames - notes
	  on refactoring -

2003-06-20 03:45  staikos

	* : more conversion to curveplacementwidget

2003-06-20 03:18  staikos

	* : factor out the curve placement code. Not much gained in terms of
	  lines of code, but the ability to change things centrally is nice,
	  and the api is cleansed a bit too.

2003-06-20 01:32  staikos

	* : more conversions to the new curve appearance widget, and add
	  more features to it

2003-06-19 23:56  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT for designer

2003-06-19 23:56  staikos

	* : convert to using the new factored out widget

2003-06-19 23:36  staikos

	* : the first refactoring in the dialogs. This one pulls out
	  curveappearance and makes it a separate widget. It is implemented
	  presently using a "Custom Widget" in designer. The equation dialog
	  was also enhanced with some setEnabled(bool) connections to
	  disable things that can't be used, a horizontal rule, some
	  rearranging, etc

2003-06-18 01:32  staikos

	* : some cleanup and bug fixes, get rid of null vectors (does this
	  break rvector at all? I would think that it does, but I can't see
	  anything broken), and put an explicit show() on the view after
	  loading a document to make sure it paints.

2003-06-17 23:24  staikos

	* : fix memory corruption

2003-06-17 23:02  staikos

	* : file saving and loading is mostly repaired, along with some
	  memory corruption in kstplot.

2003-06-15 16:58  staikos

	* : switch to using NaN for NOPOINT

2003-06-14 02:21  netterfield

	* : Better label dialog Fixed auto labels

2003-06-13 23:20  netterfield

	* : minor cleanups: -remove commented out code -remove unused
	  variable

2003-06-13 23:15  netterfield

	* : Fixed scalar substitution in labels. Labels now use the
	  KST::scalarList global. The scalar list no longer needs to be
	  passed through kstplot.

2003-06-13 22:50  netterfield

	* : *** empty log message ***

2003-06-13 22:49  netterfield

	* : Fix to symbol font in kstlabels

2003-06-13 21:02  staikos

	* : updates from the meeting today

2003-06-13 01:50  netterfield

	* : Adding kstlabeldialog* The dialog needs work (to make an
	  understatement...)

2003-06-13 01:36  staikos

	* : not needed

2003-06-13 01:26  netterfield

	* : First steps in adding arbitrarily placable labels.... Reworked
	  KstMouse in KstView Added action

2003-06-12 22:31  staikos

	* : scatter some typenames throughout to make gcc3 happy

2003-06-12 07:48  staikos

	* : add an isNull accessor here, if kstrvector is going to make it
	  null.

2003-06-12 07:34  staikos

	* : More of the refactoring done. slave vectors are history, and
	  shared pointers are used almost everywhere now. Only curves and
	  plots are unshared. Many potential bugs were fixed, and memory
	  doesn't seem to leak, though I haven't checked the "reachables"
	  yet according to valgrind. There are no other memory errors to my
	  knowledge. The only remaining problems are that "Purge" doesn't
	  work yet. This is related to usage count being broken. There is
	  still plenty of cleanup to do, including removing unused variables
	  and member variables, unused methods, and some renaming. There is
	  also some logic that can be removed now because it duplicates
	  existing logic. The lists that were once in kstdoc are now in a
	  KST:: namespace and global in order to facilitate linking purposes
	  and ease of use. Now scalars and vectors add themselves to the
	  global lists automatically. Full diff is ~4600 lines.

2003-06-12 07:22  staikos

	* : it helps to use the new variable

2003-06-12 07:19  staikos

	* : another access beyond the end of the array while interpolating.

2003-06-12 07:10  staikos

	* : don't access beyond the end of the array when scaling

2003-06-10 18:19  staikos

	* : more cleanup, remove some debug, convert to typedefs instead of
	  big template expressions, etc.

2003-06-10 16:50  staikos

	* : remove some debug, add a compile fix for the new RESTORE() macro

2003-06-10 05:08  staikos

	* : some cleanup

2003-06-10 05:03  staikos

	* : KstFile is now a KstObject. Needs more work, but everything is
	  functional it seems, except perhaps purging.

2003-06-09 23:36  staikos

	* : The next big round of changes - no more *vector*list classes
	  anymore. This is basically as functional as before, but
	  quick(psd|equation|*) may not quite work right at the moment. This
	  is easily fixed later. There are two known memory errors which
	  will go away as KstFile becomes a shared object, and as the Vector
	  classes are reworked for the final time. They don't appear to
	  cause much of a problem right now.

2003-06-03 05:42  staikos

	* : First major portion of the cleanup - refactor into
	  KstDataObjects, not counting KstFile. Vectors are not changed.
	  This removes all kinds of code duplication though much still
	  remains. Some things are still not ideal but they're getting
	  closer. It is quite likely that this patch broke things, but the
	  very basics still seem to work fine. Removes 1000-1500 lines of
	  code.

2003-06-03 00:08  staikos

	* : more reworking of the classes - dataObjectList is now used in
	  kstdoc, though the curves are still separate

2003-06-02 19:35  staikos

	* : add debug temporarily to track usage

2003-06-01 22:12  staikos

	* : count()->length() for the vector

2003-06-01 22:11  staikos

	* : Some of the changes to the vectors are started. I'm doing these
	  incrementally, and periodically somethings may break. For
	  instance, vector usage counts probably do not work right now,
	  though they will work again once the changes are complete. This
	  change mostly changes method names, adds some new ones, removes
	  some that need to disappear, etc. The next change will likely be
	  the use of KSharedPtr<> instead of the raw pointer (which will
	  -mostly- fix the usage count again). There are probably memory
	  leaks right now.

2003-06-01 21:20  staikos

	* : more cleanup

2003-06-01 20:44  staikos

	* : cleanups

2003-06-01 20:30  staikos

	* : - kstscalarlist.cpp is no longer needed - fix a bug in
	  kstcurvedialog where it didn't plot in an existing plot AND in a
	  separate plot

2003-06-01 20:25  staikos

	* : Most finish the Scalar conversion to the new object model. Seems
	  to have cleaned up many memory issues, as well as removed lots of
	  code! There is still much more code to remove or change to using
	  iterators too.

2003-05-28 21:19  staikos

	* : compile fixes

2003-05-28 21:16  staikos

	* : updates

2003-05-28 20:27  staikos

	* : add the realloced methods

2003-05-28 20:12  staikos

	* : First step in refactoring: - move functions defined in the UML
	  diagram up into parent classes - redo the inheritence (mostly
	  done) - other minor cleanups

2003-05-28 18:28  staikos

	* : init the variable

2003-05-25 18:53  staikos

	* : no use passing around static data

2003-05-25 18:40  staikos

	* : add samples for these two base classes. kstdataobject was not
	  touched because it is in use already, but it's the next one to
	  integrate.

2003-05-25 18:23  staikos

	* : this should not be in CVS

2003-05-25 17:04  staikos

	* : slight layout adjustments and resize the font for non-2560x1024
	  screens :)

2003-05-25 16:01  staikos

	* : remove the second METASOURCES line that was commented out
	  anyways.

2003-05-25 13:54  mlaurent

	* : Use KCmdLineLastOption

2003-05-25 00:48  staikos

	* : version 0.89, update copyrights

2003-05-24 02:10  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2003-05-24 01:52  staikos

	* : interpolate X as needed - not well tested, but seems to work

2003-05-24 00:32  staikos

	* : spelling fix Lable->Label

2003-05-23 21:51  staikos

	* : plugin loading and saving - as much as can be done

2003-05-23 21:22  staikos

	* : edit works as advertised now, updating the data manager
	  properly.

2003-05-23 21:15  staikos

	* : edit fixes, still not fully working. Data manager gets confused.

2003-05-23 20:48  staikos

	* : clean up vectors when new plugin fails

2003-05-23 20:15  staikos

	* : - avoid a crash by leaking memory until we can fix the
	  architecture properly - detect errors when trying to create a new
	  plugin

2003-05-23 19:53  staikos

	* : switch to using a lineedit for outputs

2003-05-23 19:09  staikos

	* : pass in a, b, chi^2 as scalars

2003-05-23 18:38  staikos

	* : typo => wrong results

2003-05-23 18:17  staikos

	* : oops

2003-05-23 17:46  staikos

	* : compiling with warning is better than erroring

2003-05-23 17:35  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT

2003-05-23 17:35  staikos

	* : line fitting plugin example

2003-05-23 01:43  staikos

	* : update - more information, slight refactoring

2003-05-23 00:58  staikos

	* : UML for the redesigned data object hierarchy

2003-05-22 23:50  staikos

	* : compilation fixes

2003-05-22 23:25  netterfield

	* : Made kstvector a kstdataobject this breaks d2asc compiles, but
	  kst is still OK: Help Made doc->scalarList a static member of
	  kstvector, so that kstvectors can insert their scalars into the
	  list. I think it would be better to add doc->scalarList to
	  KstScalar and doc->vectorList as static member of KstVector so
	  things can insert and delete themselves!

2003-05-22 23:17  staikos

	* : don't double delete

2003-05-22 23:07  staikos

	* : Fix vector leaks

2003-05-22 22:58  staikos

	* : plugin editting works, more crashes removed

2003-05-22 21:52  staikos

	* : make the dialog show the correct combobox values in edit mode.

2003-05-22 21:23  staikos

	* : Lots of plugin work. Unfortunately the vector architecture is
	  becoming a real problem now. I had to put in lots of hacks that
	  could go away if we make all vectors the same (or specialised) as
	  discussed. I think this has to happen sooner rather than later.
	  The vector list classes need to be reworked too.

2003-05-22 15:39  staikos

	* : fix scalar parsing in the XML and add widget spacing to the
	  generated dialog

2003-05-22 15:28  staikos

	* : a demo with scalars

2003-05-22 15:13  staikos

	* : This didn't work in HEAD for some reason, but worked in branch.
	  This patch ensures it works everywhere.

2003-05-22 06:26  staikos

	* : pass in the input vectors to the plugin

2003-05-22 05:52  staikos

	* : show the associated vectors, increment their usage, etc

2003-05-22 03:39  staikos

	* : update the plugins to reflect the new memory scheme

2003-05-22 03:35  staikos

	* : call the plugins

2003-05-22 03:26  staikos

	* : - change the default action in plugin dialog from delete to save
	  - make kstdataobject KShared because eventually all dataobjects
	  will be KShared probably. - return const QString& from accessor in
	  kstdataobject - note about vector and scalar lists moving into
	  kstdataobject eventually

2003-05-22 03:01  staikos

	* : - fix a bug in plugins since the change to KstDataObject - make
	  the plugin code generate unique names like the other objects - add
	  plugins to the data manager window (without the vectors currently)

2003-05-22 01:57  staikos

	* : move "Loaded" over one column. It looks better to select the
	  plugin name, not it's loaded state pixmap.

2003-05-21 18:35  netterfield

	* : Fix update bug: call update on all dependancies liberally call
	  update on all slaves use a counter to avoid re-updates note:
	  recursion is not detected, will produce junk results, but should
	  not crash

2003-05-20 13:35  staikos

	* : CVS_SILENT while you're at it, might as well make this "cannot"
	  then.

2003-05-20 08:22  binner

	* : CVS_SILENT i18n style guide fixes

2003-05-16 15:28  staikos

	* : for now, just don't crash until the code is complete

2003-05-16 08:21  staikos

	* : work on calling the plugin. slightly incomplete pending
	  discussion on memory management

2003-05-16 07:36  staikos

	* : lots of bug fixes

2003-05-16 06:36  staikos

	* : add another deep and meaningful plugin for testing

2003-05-16 06:33  staikos

	* : - missed a constructor initialisation - add debug statements to
	  show that refcounting is working

2003-05-16 06:22  staikos

	* : make it do what the xml file says it does

2003-05-16 06:14  staikos

	* : new, edit, delete of plugins works, though not all fields are
	  saved yet.

2003-05-16 04:01  staikos

	* : saving new plugins and deleting old ones now works partially

2003-05-16 03:39  staikos

	* : more plugin implementation

2003-05-16 03:07  staikos

	* : more plugin work. starting to integrate them into the app. Using
	  KSharedPtr<> instead of homebrew ref counting.

2003-05-16 02:45  staikos

	* : some thoughts

2003-05-16 01:14  staikos

	* : - fix plugin removal - minor UI fix

2003-05-16 00:47  staikos

	* : add some input and output that doesn't come close to matching
	  the plugin yet :)

2003-05-15 23:39  staikos

	* : fill in the scalar and vector lists

2003-05-15 22:00  staikos

	* : The UI generator for plugins. Parameters are not done.

2003-05-15 20:03  staikos

	* : rename

2003-05-15 17:56  staikos

	* : restore some of this code

2003-05-14 16:35  staikos

	* : switch kstxml->xml

2003-05-14 15:26  netterfield

	* : Rework of KstFile: Use QFile (where possible) and KTempFile Bug
	  fix (massive speedup) in reading data from stdin removed some
	  warnings from readdata

2003-05-14 05:17  staikos

	* : plugin installer

2003-05-14 04:28  staikos

	* : Finish reworking the plugins to load on-demand only. Fix some
	  other minor bugs, and optimize.

2003-05-14 03:01  staikos

	* : plugin changes as discussed, including: - Reference counting of
	  plugins - Load only on demand - remove unnecessary UI elements

2003-05-14 00:28  staikos

	* : Use a combobox instead of a listview

2003-05-13 23:48  staikos

	* : unused args

2003-05-13 23:38  staikos

	* : check endian

2003-05-13 18:16  staikos

	* : API to call the plugin function

2003-05-13 18:06  staikos

	* : can't use a map here since order is important

2003-05-13 17:23  staikos

	* : The plugin dialog.

2003-05-13 16:03  staikos

	* : extract the symbol from the plugin

2003-05-13 04:19  staikos

	* : demo plugin, and some fixes to the plugin manager and loader

2003-05-13 03:42  staikos

	* : bug fixes, ability to load and unload plugins on demand, gui
	  enhancements, and ability to remove plugins from the system

2003-05-13 02:24  staikos

	* : The beginning of the plugin manager, some bugfixes

2003-05-12 22:47  staikos

	* : initialise the plugin code at startup

2003-05-12 22:44  staikos

	* : slight refactoring, new method

2003-05-12 22:34  staikos

	* : A static governor for the collection of plugins that are loaded
	  at any given time.

2003-05-12 21:06  staikos

	* : plugin loader added (untested)

2003-05-12 20:12  staikos

	* : layout fix

2003-05-10 02:18  netterfield

	* : Partial re-write of kstfile: uses KTempFile for temp file
	  increased use of QFiles Increased use of QStrings There is still
	  work do be done in the ASCII data file parser.

2003-05-09 16:49  fawcett

	* : malloc.h is dead, so it can go bye-bye deprecated/obsoleted, use
	  stdlib.h instead (and you already include that)

2003-05-08 19:12  binner

	* : CVS_SILENT i18n style guide fixes

2003-05-07 23:15  staikos

	* : Convert all the forms: const SomePrimitiveType& parameter to
	  just SomePrimitiveType paramter Especially in cases where the
	  parameter had a default value. Also some i18n() and other cleanup.

2003-05-07 22:18  staikos

	* : - some i18n fixes - get rid of unnecessary casts - don't cast
	  (QString)"foo". Use QString("foo") if really needed, or better,
	  rework it so it can be i18n("") - (float)foo -> float(foo) etc -
	  const bool& is a bad idea and does nothing of benefit over bool.

2003-05-07 22:03  staikos

	* : more const/inheritence cleanup

2003-05-07 21:44  staikos

	* : better be safe with free()

2003-05-07 21:42  staikos

	* : Let's use malloc/free here for now then. Also cleanups,
	  refactorizations, micro optimisations

2003-05-07 20:29  staikos

	* : fix new[]/delete mismatch. Still, this code also uses realloc().
	  Needs more work.

2003-05-07 20:08  staikos

	* : memleak fix

2003-05-07 19:57  staikos

	* : note for future

2003-05-07 19:53  staikos

	* : A huge number of memory corruption/leak bugfixes, i18n() fixes,
	  constness fixes, inheritence fixes, and more.

2003-05-07 18:36  staikos

	* : The last uninitialised var (tricky to track this one down). Also
	  a few minor reformatting and setting freed variables to 0L.

2003-05-07 17:21  staikos

	* : - Don't allow access to array[-1]. - Make the for(;;); a little
	  more explicit

2003-05-07 17:12  staikos

	* : last of the leaks for now, as well as some const fixes and cast
	  changes

2003-05-07 13:48  mlaurent

	* : Add const

2003-05-07 12:02  netterfield

	* : CVS_SILENT made messages

2003-05-07 09:57  netterfield

	* : Un-broke file reading.

2003-05-07 08:50  coolo

	* : little cleanup (note though that the actions icons were better
	  installed into kde_datadir instead of kde_icondir. But that
	  requires code changes)

2003-05-06 22:22  staikos

	* : Don't leak, init variables

2003-05-06 21:59  staikos

	* : Fix uninit variables. This could cause crashes on non-GCC
	  compilers. (especially SIGFPE)

2003-05-06 21:27  staikos

	* : Representation class for a plugin - presently empty until we get
	  a plugin example and can complete the plugin loader

2003-05-06 21:20  staikos

	* : The rest of the plugin XML parser

2003-05-06 19:41  staikos

	* : plugin XML file parser - 2/3 complete

2003-05-06 17:46  netterfield

	  libRD; Moved useful readdata files to source directory.
