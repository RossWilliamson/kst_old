Suggested Filter Set 
========================

A set of filters should be called a Filter Set to avoid confusion
with the actual filter plugins.

Changes to Data Manager
-----------------------
- In the "New" section to the left, a new button should be added
called "Filter Set..."

- Clicking this button will bring up a dialog similar to other
dialogs for data objects - see Screenshot-filterset.png.  Clicking the
Configure... button will bring up a configuration dialog for the
selected filter, where scalar inputs can be entered or edited.

- Once a filter set is created, it will show up in the list of
data objects, and will contain slave vectors (the filtered vectors).

- Using these slave vectors, other objects such as curves can be
created.

(Possible) Changes to Plot Context Menu
---------------------------------------
- A shortcut for creating filter sets could be added to the right-click
plot context menu

- Under the Fit submenu, add another selection called "Filter..."

- Click this will bring up the Edit Filter Set dialog, with the vectors
used in the plot preselected.

Changes to Data Wizard
----------------------
If "Apply Filters" is checked on the second page, and intermediate
filter selection page should be displayed 
(see Screenshot-datawizard-filterset.png)
