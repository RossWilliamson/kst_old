Items marked with *** require a change from the current behavior.

ToolBar
There should a pull down icon menuin the tool bar with the following entries:
* XY, X, and Y zoom icons
* Layout mode, Text, Line, Arrow, Box, Ellipse, picture
* The last icon selected from the list is the one which shows.  

Zoom Modes (XY, X and Y zoom modes)
2d plot modes which are only valid for 2d plots.  The current behavior for clicks inside the plot area of these there modes is correct.

For all of these modes, the right button menu should include:
....
Layout Mode:
Â Used to move and edit any data view object.  
* All mouse actions applies to the highest level object the mouse is over.
* ***The mouse's target area is ~20% of the size of the mouse icon.***
* Single click on an object selects it.  A selected object is marked by a filled rectangle. 
* A double click on a view object selects the object, and pops up the objects edit dialog. (eg, PlotDialog for plot, labeldialog for labels, etc).
* A drag on a view object moves the object and all of its children.
* *** Mouse actions are independent of whether the object is a child object or not. Drags drag, clicks select, double clicks edit. ***
* *** On drop, an object becomes the child of the highest object to completely contain it.  This may be the top level view ***
* A drag on the hot point of a data object changes the object's geometry and all of its children.
* The mouse icon will change depending on where it is.  The current behavior is correct.
* Visual feedback as to what object would be selected or moved will be given by showing an open rectangle around the object's hotpoint.
* The hotpoints are located as follows:
* Plots, rectangles, text objects: hotpoints on the 4 corners, and 4 midpoints.  Drags on the corners do XY resizing.  Drags on the midpoints do either X or Y resizing.
* Lines: Hot points at each end.  Drags on the hotpoints move the point.  Drags anywhere else moves the line.
* Ellipse: Hot points at noon, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00

Text Mode
* *** Icon changes to the text | icon. ***
* ***Clicking calls up a text dialog for entry.  It will placed relative to the click point based on the selection of 'justification'.***

* The line goes from the first click to the second click.
* The line is drawn from the first click to the mouse until the 2nd click.
* <Esc> cancels the line.
* For arrows, the head is at the 2nd click.
* An arrow is just a line with the 2nd arrow head shown by default.  A line can be turned to an arrow or an arrow to a line in the dialog.

Ellipse:
* Arrow Icon
* First click is at centre.
* Second is at extended corner.
* The ellipse is drawn as the mouse is moved.
* <Esc> cancels the circle.
* There is no concept of a circle: the dimensions are relative the parent.
