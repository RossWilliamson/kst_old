Zoom Mode Plot Bugs:
  -Zooming gets slower the more points there are in the curves. It should
  always be fast.


Zoom lines not updated on <ctrl> or <shift>
what happens:
  Put the mouse in a plot and depress <ctrl>.  Nothing Happens.
  Now move the mouse.  A vertical line appears where the mouse is.
  Move the mouse around.  The line follows the mouse.
  Now release <ctrl>.  The line stays until the mouse is moved again.
What should happen:
  The line should appear when <ctrl> is pressed, and disappear when
  <ctrl> is released, independent of mouse moves.
  
Tied X-Only (<ctrl>) zooms adjust X and Y.
What happens:
  create two plots (eg, 1 of gyrodata.dat col 1 and one from gyrodata.dat 
  col 2).  Make sure they have different Y ranges.  Tie their zooms.  Now
  adjust the X-range only from one plot with <ctrl>+mouse.  Both plots end up
  with the same X and Y range.
What should happen:
  Only the X range should change.
