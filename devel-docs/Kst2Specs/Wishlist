Shared axis from the command line

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

------------

Fixup line/arrow dimensions tab:
  x,y instead of length/angle

----------

Scientific notation (instead of C's %e notation) for extreme axis numbers

--------

Edit multiple for other view objects (arrow, line, label...)

--------

data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory (QDirModel doesn't handle this...)
   (nor QDir, though QDir seems to know about $HOME).

1.x kst file read compatibility...

--------------------

When you have many plots on a window (like 35), and the numbers in
the axis labels are large, they often overwrite each other (so you can't
tell any of the numbers apart).  

--------------------

in <ctrl> or <shift> zoom modes the line cursor should appear in all tied plots.

--------------------

Legends can get larger than the plot if there are enought things in them.  This should not be. 

--------

vector selectors in curve dialog can't grow when you extend the window size.

-------

Some automagic way of deciding if plugin dialogs can make plots.
