Export eps to vector format.
  kst 1.x did this by printing to file a .ps file, and then modifying it by adding the bounding box.

------------

Shared axis from the command line

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

------------

Fixup line/arrow dimensions tab:
  x,y instead of length/angle


----------

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.

----------

Scientific notation (instead of C's %e notation) for extreme axis numbers

--------

Edit multiple for other view objects (arrow, line, label...)

--------

data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory (QDirModel doesn't handle this...)
   (nor QDir, though QDir seems to know about $HOME).

------------

1.x kst file read compatibility...

------------

DECIDE: absolute or relative file names in kst files?
  kst1.x uses absolute.  This becomes a problem when the directory changes.

-----------

Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

After the label creation dialog has been applied, attach the label to
the mouse, to allow it to be dragged around until placed by a click.

---------

Change Data Sample Ranges doesn't have an icon on the menu bar (that I
found); it was very convienient there.

--------------------

The data manager doesn't have a purge button.

--------------------

New Equation (or new pretty much anything) is harder to find as they
seem to be only available through the data manager.  

--------------------

When looking at dirfile data, if the symlink changes, kst doesn't notice
and one has to hit reload to get it to update.  This is annoying at
best.

--------------------

Perhaps unrelated to kst, but the new symbolic link name in defile
(replacing the defile.cur indirect file) is retarded.  It slows me down
and the double extension is pointless.
