Export eps to vector format.
  kst 1.x did this by printing to file a .ps file, and then modifying it by adding the bounding box.

------------

Shared axis from the command line

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

------------

Fixup line/arrow dimensions tab:
  x,y instead of length/angle

----------

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.

----------

Scientific notation (instead of C's %e notation) for extreme axis numbers

--------

Edit multiple for other view objects (arrow, line, label...)

--------

Edit multiple for vectors

--------

data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory (QDirModel doesn't handle this...)
   (nor QDir, though QDir seems to know about $HOME).

------------

1.x kst file read compatibility...

------------

DECIDE: absolute or relative file names in kst files?
  kst1.x uses absolute.  This becomes a problem when the directory changes.

-----------

Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

After the label creation dialog has been applied, attach the label to
the mouse, to allow it to be dragged around until placed by a click.

---------

The data manager doesn't have a purge button.

Thread kst2

--------------------

When you have many plots on a window (like 35), and the numbers in
the axis labels are large, they often overwrite each other (so you can't
tell any of the numbers apart).  

--------------------

1. When the x axis set to to interpret as standard C time, the time is
displayed correctly on the axis labels, but just displays as the raw
value in the status bar (on the lower left of the window).  This is both
in "normal mode" and in "data mode".

--------------------

3. Data mode no longer easily finds the point nearest the cursor.
In kst 1.x, you could easily get datamode to locate points on a spike or
other outlier on a dense curve, but now it actually seems to pick the
point at the current x value, even if the cursor is significantly closer
to a different point.  

--------------------

4. When displaying an axis as time, "offset mode" turns on (good), but
only displays offsets in seconds (bad).  When a day's worth of data is
on the screen, the unit shouldn't be seconds, or even minutes.  

--------------------

5. When displaying an axis as time and offset mode is on, the offset
steps should be natural for the type of units.  100 seconds is not
natural (120 would be, or better, 2 minutes; see the bug above).
