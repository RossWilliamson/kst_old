Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

15. The text label behaviour is un-intuitive.  The typical interface is
to choose a position first, and then input some text.
   ** -a possible justification for the current order is that it could allow us to 
      drag around the label once we have defined it, for more precision placement.
      not sure yet if we should change anything. **

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.

----------

Printing from the command line.  This existed in 1.x
  Note: printing still requires parts of Qt which require a window session, so pure scripted 
  headless prints are not possible :-(

--------

Scientific notation (instead of C's %e notation) for extreme axis numbers

--------

Edit multiple for other view objects (arrow, line, label...)

--------

Export eps to vector format.
  kst 1.x did this by printing to file a .ps file, and then modifying it by adding the bounding box.

------------

data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory (QDirModel doesn't handle this...)
   (nor QDir, though QDir seems to know about $HOME).

------------

1.x kst file read compatibility...

------------

DECIDE: absolute or relative file names in kst files?
  kst1.x uses absolute.  This becomes a problem when the directory changes.

------------

Fixup line/arrow dimensions tab:
  x,y instead of length/angle

------------

Names in multipage graphics file export.  name_2.png, not name.png_2, etc

-----------

Improve behavior of data wizard selector

----------

Shared axis from the command line
