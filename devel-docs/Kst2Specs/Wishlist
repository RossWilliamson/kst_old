Axis Label Rotation:
  Axis number labels should be rotateable, as in 1.x

----------
Base / Offset mode logic change:
  Base/offset should have three modes:
    On: Base/offset mode is used, regardless of if it is needed (same as current 'on')
    Auto: Base/offset mode is used if doing so makes sense (same as current 'off')
    Off: Base/offset mode is never used.

----------
New Plot Label size mode: autoshrink.
  Add a an option to plot labels: autoshrink.  If selected, the font size used for the axis labels will reduced to the largest size (<= the current size) for which the labels don't overlap or are not truncated (only text width is considered.).  The resizing is dynamic.  If the window geometry or the label values change so that the label would fit at a larger size, the size is raised.
 - Last step after base/offset & reduced ticks.
----------

Edit Multiple for Plots
  It should be possible to edit the properties of multiple plots at once.  The UI used in data objects and in 1.x works well and should be used here.

----------

New tab in Data Wizard:
  There should be an option in the data wizard to create all of the new plots in a new tab.  1.x has this.

----------

XY Plots and Spectra in separate new tabs in data wizard.
  If XY plots and Spectra are both being created, there should be an option to create the Specta in a separate new tab.  1.x has this.

----------
Placement widget (eg, in the curve dialog)  needs a create in new tab option.
  1.x had a 'create new tab' button.  This is similar, but does
the creation of the new tab after apply, and uses a default name rather than popping up a new dialog.

---------
When a new plot is added to an tab which already has plots in it (eg, from the Placement widget), then the label font sizes should be based on the label font sizes of the plots already in the tab.  (either 'vote' or use the first one).
All font properties replicated.  Use the first one.
---------

Default X vector should be remembered.
  -A default X vector, which is the last vector to have been used as an X vector, should be remembered. 

---------

'I' key in a plot with an image should adjust the image color scale; see 1.x for correct behavior.  Consider <shift>I as doing smaller steps.

---------

Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

---------

Smart selection of minor tick intervals.
  There needs to be an option to automatically chose the number of minor tick intervals: 
  If the major interval is 1x10^n or 5x10^n there should be 5 minor intervals.  
  If it is 2x10^n, there should be 4.
  This was in 1.x

---------

Change File Dialog is confusing.  It is not clear what the two filters at the top do, and the 
way they do it is inconsistent: The top is applyed when you hit the all from button.  The next one
is live, and the button clears the selection.  There is no way to combine the options.
  Better: a file text entry and a regexp text entry, an apply filters button, and an 'and/or' radio pair.
