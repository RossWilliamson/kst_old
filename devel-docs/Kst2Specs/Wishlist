----------
New Plot Label size mode: autoshrink.
  Add a an option to plot labels: autoshrink.  If selected, the font size used for the axis labels will reduced to the largest size (<= the current size) for which the labels don't overlap or are not truncated (only text width is considered.).  The resizing is dynamic.  If the window geometry or the label values change so that the label would fit at a larger size, the size is raised.
 - Last step after base/offset & reduced ticks.
----------

Placement widget (eg, in the curve dialog)  needs a create in new tab option.
  1.x had a 'create new tab' button.  This is similar, but does
the creation of the new tab after apply, and uses a default name rather than popping up a new dialog.

---------
When a new plot is added to an tab which already has plots in it (eg, from the Placement widget), then the label font sizes should be based on the label font sizes of the plots already in the tab.  (either 'vote' or use the first one).
All font properties replicated.  Use the first one.

---------

'I' key in a plot with an image should adjust the image color scale; see 1.x for correct behavior.  Consider <shift>I as doing smaller steps.

---------

Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

---------

Change File Dialog is confusing.  It is not clear what the two filters at the top do, and the 
way they do it is inconsistent: The top is applyed when you hit the all from button.  The next one
is live, and the button clears the selection.  There is no way to combine the options.
  Better: a file text entry and a regexp text entry, an apply filters button, and an 'and/or' radio pair.


15. The text label behaviour is un-intuitive.  The typical interface is
to choose a position first, and then input some text.
   ** -a possible justification for the current order is that it could allow us to 
      drag around the label once we have defined it, for more precision placement.
      not sure yet if we should change anything. **
