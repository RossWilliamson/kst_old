When a new plot is added to an tab which already has plots in it (eg, from the Placement widget), then the label font sizes should be based on the label font sizes of the plots already in the tab.  (either 'vote' or use the first one).
All font properties replicated.  Use the first one.

Easier way to specify reversed axis when loading sky images:
  -can desire to reverse be gleaned from the fits image?
  -command line option?
  -new-image (sticky) option?

---------

Smarter ASCII reader:
  should be able to use huristics to get information about
  the ascii file.
    (eg, is it a CSV?  Does it have a field name header?)
  these should be used only for new files, and should be used to sed the defaults, which can still be changed with 'configure'.

15. The text label behaviour is un-intuitive.  The typical interface is
to choose a position first, and then input some text.
   ** -a possible justification for the current order is that it could allow us to 
      drag around the label once we have defined it, for more precision placement.
      not sure yet if we should change anything. **

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.

Printing from the command line.  This existed in 1.x

--------

Scientific notation for extreme axis numbers

Edit multiple for all view objects.  The highest priority is legends.
