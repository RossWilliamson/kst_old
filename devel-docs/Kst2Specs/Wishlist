----------
Axis Label Rotation:
  Axis number labels should be rotateable, as in 1.x

----------
Base / Offset mode logic change:
  Base/offset should have three modes:
    On: Base/offset mode is used, regardless of if it is needed (same as current 'on')
    Auto: Base/offset mode is used if doing so makes sense (same as current 'off')
    Off: Base/offset mode is never used.

----------
New Plot Label size mode: autoshrink.
  Add a an option to plot labels: autoshrink.  If selected, the font size used for the axis labels will reduced to the largest size (<= the current size) for which the labels don't overlap or are not truncated (only text width is considered.).  The resizing is dynamic.  If the window geometry or the label values change so that the label would fit at a larger size, the size is raised.

----------

Edit Multiple for Plots
  It should be possible to edit the properties of multiple plots at once.  The UI used in data objects and in 1.x works well and should be used here.

----------

New tab in Data Wizard:
  There should be an option in the data wizard to create all of the new plots in a new tab.  1.x has this.

----------

XY Plots and Spectra in separate new tabs in data wizard.
  If XY plots and Spectra are both being created, there should be an option to create the Specta in a separate new tab.  1.x has this.

----------
Placement widget (eg, in the curve dialog)  needs a create in new tab option.
  1.x had a 'create new tab' button.  This is similar, but does
the creation of the new tab after apply, and uses a default name rather than popping up a new dialog.

---------
When a new plot is added to an tab which already has plots in it (eg, from the Placement widget), then the label font sizes should be based on the label font sizes of the plots already in the tab.  (either 'vote' or use the first one).
