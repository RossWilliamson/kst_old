1) Problems with lines and arrows:
Start kst
Create a box in the right hand side of the tlv, that does not fill the tlv.
Create a line or arrow which points to the bottom left corner of the box.
Shrink or grow the kst window.
  What Happens:
  The box changes size, keeping the corners fixed relative to the TLV.  The arrow shrinks as well, keeping
  the angle fixed so that the top left end of the line moves relative to the tlv.
  What should happen:
  The box behaves correctly.
  *BOTH end points of the arrow or line should stay fixed relative to the tlv**

Comments: lines and arrows go from A to B, where A and B are defined **relative to the parent**.
The UI should just have two handles, at A and B.  There should be no 'rotation mode'.

6) Font sizes in plot
Start Kst
Create a plot
Resize the kst window.
What happens:
  The font sizes for the labels changes in large steps .
What should happen:
  The fonts should scale smoothly with the window size.
