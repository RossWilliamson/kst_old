Crash deleting last tab:
start kst, and in the only tab, select rmb->close.  CRASH!
This is especially a problem since this is what TabWidget->clear() does.  TabWidget->clear() is used when opening
a file to get rid of all of the old tabs.   As a temp hack (to allow file opening) clear() is not called on file open,
so all of the old tabs linger after opening a file.  This should be reverted once the bug is fixed.
