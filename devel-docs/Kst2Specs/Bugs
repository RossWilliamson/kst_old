Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.

---------

Tooltips everywhere.


---------

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.

----------

Y Axis label placement is wrong
Create a plot with 24 curves from the data wizard.  The Y axis label is offset vertically.

------------

'c' mode doesn't show difference.
'c' mode is used to find the offset from a marker to the cursor.
Currently, if 'c' is hit, a marker is placed, as it should.  However, the difference between the marker and the cursor is not shown anywhere.  See 1.x for the correct behavior.
