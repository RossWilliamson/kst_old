in non-GL mode
  -on a zoom, the axis labels are note fully redrawn until the mouse leaves the plot.
Always:
  -Tick labels are cut off at the top of the plot.  They should extend to their whole height.
  
In ctrl or shift zoom mode, the cursor should change, and the full horizontal or vertical dashed line should be shown immediately.  As it is now, the line isn't shown until a rect draw has begun. (not in spec - should be)

If you zoom in far enough, the tick labels loose resolution, and don't automatically shift to base/offset mode.
eg, range fro 99999.499 to 99999.5001 shows all ticks as 99999.5 

Log mode does not change the axis into log axis.

Vector Dialog:
  autocompletion in file name selection widget

Matrix: generate gradient is useless and can be removed from dialog.
Scaling and translation should apply to any matrix.
