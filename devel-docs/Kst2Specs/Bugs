Draw an ellipse that spans many plots.  It ends up in the back, and can't be brought to the front.

Artifacts when resizing large arrowheads.

--------------------

Curves are rendered slightly above where they should be.  Take a plot
that it is of very boring data (like always exactly zero) and it'll be
drawn one pixel above the axis tick mark for zero.  
  (Ticks and curves use different rounding)

--------------------

Text for labels and axes is rendered (anti-aliased) non-uniformly.  One
plot may look sharp whereas the plot immediately below it will have text
that looks blurry (even out of focus).  

--------------------

When in data mode, the position of the data mode indicator and the
values in the bottom status bar only update if you move the mouse.  When
live data is scrolling by and the mouse is still, the data mode
indicator scrolls off the plot with the data (until you jiggle the
mouse).

Cleanup layout totally sucks!
