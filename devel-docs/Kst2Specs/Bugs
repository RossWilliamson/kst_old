Bugs in Build System:
  -picks up libraries in lib/X11 before local libs
  -doesn't support 'make install' nor DESTDIR
---------

Plot axis number rounding bug:
occasionally, the axis numbers can be something like 0.499999999993 instead of 0.5.  It is hard to
reproduce.

---------

Number of major ticks bug:
Occasionally there will be too few (<2) or too many (serious overlap) in the number of major 
ticks.  This seems to have changed from 1.x

---------

Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
*cbn*
---------

No space allocated for subscripts or superscripts in axis lables
  The subscript is cut off

---------

Formatting/spacing issues:
  -Superscript and subscript size and position seems off.  This should be researched more
  but wikipedia as an almost reasonable article on it.  It suggests both should be scaled by ~60%, and subscripts dropped by 16% and superscripts raised by 44%.  OOffice, illustrator, and photoshop use scale 58%, raise 33%, lower 33%.  msoffice uses 65%, -14%, +35%.  It might also pay to compare w/ TeX.

  -The spacing between the X-axis numbers and the axis is too small.
  -The spacing between the Y-axis numbers and the axis doesn't seem to scale with window size.
  -The plot selection buttons are too small.

---------

Fragility in moving parents:
  create a plot.
  Put a child box in the plot.
  Rapidly resize the plot.  Sometimes the box will either drift or loose parenting altogether.
  (Editorial: Fundamentally, I think this is because qt's QGraphics system has been used to track placement
  of objects, and QGraphics doesn't have the right model of what we are doing.)

---------

Tooltips everywhere.

---------

With multiple plots, when zooming one changes the size properties of
another (due to axis label changes, for example), the axes labels on the
non-modified plot(s) can get garbled until the mouse is moved over them.

----------

Data mode (see 1.x) should be implemented

----------
 
Reference point (see 1.x, 'c')  should be implemented.

----------
 
Export as png with a set width and height shows transparency (blank)
where extra space is, rather than resizing the view for the export.

----------
 
Kst should ask about saving the .kst file on exit if the document has changed
(basically, any change other than a mouse/arrow zoom).  See 1.x.

----------
 
.kst should be appended to the name of a .kst file if it is not already there.

---------

kst reads live dirfiles less efficiently than before. �On a shitty
computer (devlin666), kst1.7 can display 200 frames of 24 bolometer
channels (100Hz samples; 20 samples per frame) with a 500ms kst update
timer, and only use about 20% of the cpu and the computer will still
seem 'responsive enough'. �kst2 under the same conditions, except with
2000ms kst update timer uses about 55% of the cpu and the computer (and
kst) seem more sluggish. �

---------

datawizard generated multiple plots per view have the font size for
the lables way too big (so big that, in the case of 24 plots), the axis
labels take up >75% of the real estate. �The wizard should chose the font
based on the number of plots that will be in the tlv when finished.

--------

The first pane of the data wizard should be reading directories in
the background, instead of in the foreground where it steals X focus
until the directory is read. �I ran into a interminable-focus-stealing
problem where kst was attempting to read a dead NFS mount. �Required an
X restart.

--------

No way to cancel a drawing command.
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box)
  Change your mind.... tough - you have to draw something.
*Mike*
--------

No visible feedback as to what drawing mode you are in...
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box).  There is no visible indication
  that you just selected a drawing tool.  The tool should be clearly shown 
  either with the toolbar icon remaining depressed until the action is
  finished, or in the mouse icon.
*Mike*
--------

In labels, \textbf{text} and \textit{text} set bold and italics for 'text',
but they don't un-set bold and italics after the end of the curley brackets.
They should.

--------

Should add some more latex mode fields
  \odot

--------

Line Endpoints drift relative to plot contents:
Create a plot.  Put a line in the plot.  Resize the plot.
The end points of the line don't stay fixed in plot space.  
It seems to have something to do with the 'centerpoint' of the line.
It rotates around an end point.
This problem doesn't happen with boxes.
*Mike*
--------

Tied zoom behavior oddness:
Tied zoom has been implemented as a toggle button, setting or unsetting
all of the zoom ties.  However, when in tied zoom, it is still possible to un-tie
individual plots (which is good).  But: when you un-tie one of several plots, perhaps
the tied zoom button should become disabled, as you are no longer in all-tied zoom mode.
