Draw an ellipse that spans many plots.  It ends up in the back, and can't be brought to the front.

Artifacts when resizing large arrowheads.

--------------------

Curves are rendered slightly above where they should be.  Take a plot
that it is of very boring data (like always exactly zero) and it'll be
drawn one pixel above the axis tick mark for zero.  (This is not always the same - sometimes above, sometimes below, sometimes right.)
So: it appears that ticks and curves use different rounding

Probably related bug: points don't always appear centered on the line.

Missing defaults for ascii files
erase all kst config files to simulate running kst for the first time.

The following debug comments are spewed:
Using unset value  Comment Delimiters 
Using unset value  Filename Pattern 
Using unset value  Column Delimiter 
Using unset value  Column Width 
Using unset value  Data Start 
Using unset value  Read Fields 
Using unset value  Use Dot 
...etc

Opening the dialog has no defaults set for these.  There should be.

--------------------

With live data, occasionally the last few (several) samples show as a
flat-line (at about the value of the last sample at the previous update)
which magically fixes itself upon the next update.  I think I have
reported this before.

----------------------

With live data, add a label which contains a scalar showing the
"Last" value of a vector.  As the data is scrolling by, sometimes this
scalar will indicate a value strikingly similar to the "Min" (or perhaps
"First") value on the plot rather than the Last value.

----------------------

'z' mode with shared axis messes up:
  -still draws unneeded plots
  -doesn't draw hidden axis.
