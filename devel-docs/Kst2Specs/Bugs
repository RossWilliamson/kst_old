Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

--------------------

Update ineffciency:
One plot gets re-drawn twice in an update in PlotItem::updatePlotPixmap. (?)

--------------------

Save as default should not default to checked in ascii configure dialog.

--------------------

The Y axis label  drifts when you resize the height of a plot with the top grip.  
Then, pull up the Plot Edit dialog, dimensions tab.  Enable 'apply' by 
selecting, then unselecting 'fix aspect ratio'.  Apply.  The plot moves, 
but the Y label is back where it should be.  Enable apply again, and hit 
apply.  The plot is back where it should be, with no problems.

--------------------

Draw a line in a plot.  Resize the plot.  The line drifts away.

--------------------

Draw an ellipse that spans many plots.  It ends up in the back, and can't be brought to the front.
