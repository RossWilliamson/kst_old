Update curve after editing equation
Create a plot with a curve from an equation.
    eg, x = 0..100, y = x
Put the plot in auto zoom ('m') mode.
Edit the equation to change its Y range
    eg, x = 0..100, y = 2x
On apply, nothing changes.
Do something that causes the curve to redraw (eg, resize the window).
The curve redraws, but the Y zoom range stays at the old range.  'm' resets to the old zoom range.
Now edit the curve, do nothing, and hit OK.  Still no change.
Now do something to redraw the plot.  'm' mode now works.

Problems with file selector
If you browse to select a dirfile, the name of the previous dirfile has been put into "File name:" entry.  So you have to erase it to select a dirfile.
Of course, selecting a data file replaces the old name with a new one, but there is no way to clear it selecting a dirfile.
If the 'current file' is a dirfile, then the File name entry should be blank.
Either:
  always clear the current file: entry when a directory is changed, and don't fill it in the first place if the default file is a directory
Or:
  Check to see if the current directory is recognized as a valid datasource - if it is, clear the current file entry.


--------
Places where text labels are entered need string and scalar selectors to aid in the insertion of 
strings and scalars (eg, primarily label editor)

--------
Filters should have default values
  eg, low pass filter should default to order = 4, lowpass  = 0.1: see 1.x for defaults.

-------
Butterworth low-pass crashes.
  create a plot, apply filter with order=4, lowpass = 0.01.  Crash.

-------
When chosing to filter a curve from the plot rmb, the input vectors should be fixed to the right thing:
  eg, Butterworth low pass Y vector should be fixed to the Y vector of the curve selected in the RMB menue.

-------
Entering a numerical value into a scalar selector should create a scalar of that value, if there is not
already a scalar of that name.  This is particularly important for plugin entries.  It can be created when
the scalar that the selector has selected is asked for.

--------
Only curfiles can be chosen from the command line or from the data wizard.
  dirfiles aren't recognized at all
  ascii files can't find any fields
