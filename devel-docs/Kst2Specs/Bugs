Places where text labels are entered need string and scalar selectors to aid in the insertion of 
strings and scalars (eg, primarily label editor)

---------

Tied zoom problems: (see devel-docs/Kst2Specs/Plot Geometry.pdf, last page).
  -The tied zoom conditions are not honored
  -The parent option condition is not met.  In fact, there is no way to set parent options, even if there were parent options.
  -The plots are not automatically re-sized to have equal size once the axis are shared.

---------

Missing tab in pot dialog:
  -There is no tab to manually set plot zoom ranges.  There should be (see 1.x).

---------

Plot axis number rounding bug:
occasionally, the axis numbers can be something like 0.499999999993 instead of 0.5.  It is hard to
reproduce.

---------

Number of major ticks bug:
Occasionally there will be too few (<2) or too many (serious overlap) in the number of major 
ticks.  This seems to have changed from 1.x
