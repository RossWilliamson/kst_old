Label Parsing
place a special characters in a plot label (eg, \omega in the X axis label).
The special character is not interpreted.  It should be.
Note: it is interpreted properly in floating labels.

Plot ranges don't update.
Create a plot with a curve of sine vs INDEX from dm.cur.  Read from end the last 100 frames.  In the plot hit 'm'.
What happens:
  As the curve is updated it dissappears from the plot.  Hitting 'm' recenters the curve.
What should happen:
  In 'm' zoom mode, the plot ranges should dynamically update to cover the full range of the curve on every curve update (As if you were holding 'm' down continuously.  Try kst1.x for a demonstration of the appropriate behavior.

Rotated labels in boxes drift on resize...
Create a box in kst.  Put a label in the box.  Rotate the label.
Repeatedly resize the box.
What Happens:
  The location of the label in the box drifts (so when the box is set back to
  its original position, the label is not in its original position).
What Should happen:
  location of the label should stay fixed relative to the size of the box,
  so that when the box is returned to its original size, the label returns
  to its original position.
Note: if the text label is not rotated, it doesn't seem to drift.
