Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

--------------------

Drawing a circle places it behind plots.  It should be in front!

--------------------

Problem resizing plots:
resizing a plot from the top or left grip points blanks out part of the plot.
Using the bottom right grip does not.

--------------------

Update ineffciency:
One plot gets re-drawn twice in an update in PlotItem::updatePlotPixmap. (?)

--------------------

Save as default should not default to checked in ascii configure dialog.
