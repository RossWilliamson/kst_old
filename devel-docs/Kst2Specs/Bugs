Zoom Mode Plot Bugs:

In ctrl or shift zoom mode, the cursor should change, and the full horizontal or vertical
dashed line should be shown immediately.  As it is now, the line isn't shown until a rect
draw has begun. (See Zoom Modes spec or kst 1.x)

If you zoom in far enough, the tick labels loose resolution, and don't automatically shift to base/offset mode.
eg, range fro 99999.499 to 99999.5001 shows all ticks as 99999.5 

Log mode does not change the axis into log axis.
