------------
Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

------------
Only absolute file names seem to work. 
  -data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory.
Note:  Resolve symlinks is turned on, but ~ is not processed by QDirModel completer.
 -[cbn: under linux, relative file names don't seem to work at all.]

------------------------------

USAGE() does not exit cleanly, so there are issues under windows:
 For the « kst --help » I first get the message
“Runtime Error! Program: c:\Program\klst\bin\kst.exe This application has requested the runtim to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

Then kst closes and and I get the help in the console (cygwin) in the windows cmd.exe I don’t get any help…

--------------------

Showstopper printing problems:  - 2.0 needs these fixed.  otherwise, another beta :-(

Labels in Print to file are not vector quality... they should be.
This appears to be related to caching of labels...

Increasing the printer resolution to "high resolution" solves this, at the expense of huge pdf files, and very
slow print rendering.  Printed files should be all vector, not cached pixmaps.

--------------------

Line widths on the screen don't mean the same thing (visually) as they do on the printer.  We need to come
up with a reasonable definition.  (currently, we mean 'pixels').

Line widths need a reasonable (sticky?) default.

--------------------

Drawing a circle places it behind plots.  It should be in front!
