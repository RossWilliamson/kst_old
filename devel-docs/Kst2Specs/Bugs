Names from matrixes are not properly escaped (eg, a field called flux_89)

-------------------

More than one shared axis group.  Tied zoom doesn't work right.

--------------------

Curves are rendered slightly above where they should be.  Take a plot
that it is of very boring data (like always exactly zero) and it'll be
drawn one pixel above the axis tick mark for zero.  (This is not always the same - sometimes above, sometimes below, sometimes right.)
So: it appears that ticks and curves use different rounding

Probably related bug: points don't always appear centered on the line.
