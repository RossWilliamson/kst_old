Update curve after editing equation
Create a plot with a curve from an equation.
    eg, x = 0..100, y = x
Put the plot in auto zoom ('m') mode.
Edit the equation to change its Y range
    eg, x = 0..100, y = 2x
On apply, nothing changes.
Do something that causes the curve to redraw (eg, resize the window).
The curve redraws, but the Y zoom range stays at the old range.  'm' resets to the old zoom range.
Now edit the curve, do nothing, and hit OK.  Still no change.
Now do something to redraw the plot.  'm' mode now works.

Editing a slave vector from a vector selector should bring up the
edit dialog for the provider.  Instead it brings up a vector edit 
dialog.... not what is wanted and won't work anyway.
(cbn to fix this)

-----------
Editing a slave scalar from a scalar selector should bring up the
edit dialog for the provider.  Instead it brings up a scalar edit 
dialog.... not what is wanted and won't work anyway.

Cur files no longer work.
Select a cur file from dirfile_maker.  It thinks its a ascii file.

--------
Files can't be chosen from the command line (Same behavior as data wizard).
  dirfiles aren't recognized at all
  ascii files return empty 

--------
Data sources can't be selected from the data wizard.
Try to select an ascii file or a dirfile using the data wizard.  It doesn't work.

Problems with file selector
If you browse to select a dirfile, the name of the previous dirfile has been put into "File name:" entry.  So you have to erase it to select a dirfile.
Of course, selecting a data file replaces the old name with a new one, but there is no way to clear it selecting a dirfile.
If the 'current file' is a dirfile, then the File name entry should be blank.
Either:
  always clear the current file: entry when a directory is changed, and don't fill it in the first place if the default file is a directory
Or:
  Check to see if the current directory is recognized as a valid datasource - if it is, clear the current file entry.


--------
Places where text labels are entered need string and scalar selectors to aid in the insertion of 
strings and scalars (eg, primarily label editor)
