Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **

Image dialog 'smart' range calculations seem to be... odd.

Shared axis zoom usage problem:
Create a shared axis zoom box with multiple plots in a column.
  -there is no option to indicate or change whether the plots are tied.

Zoom into one of them.
  -All plots do exactly the same zoom, as if they were tied.

Correct behavior:
  -There should still be tied zoom indicators.
  -If the tied zoom indicators are not checked, then the shared axis 
  should behave as if it were tied, but the other should not.
  -If the tied zoom indicators are checked, then it should tie both axis.

(ie, if only the x axis is shared, then only the x axis is tied; if only 
 the y axis is shared, only the y axis is tied.)

If axis are shared, then they must always have exactly the same
range.  So 'M' (autoscale) must be set to the Max/Min over all of the 
plots with the shared axis, not each inividually.

---------------------------

Shared axis not shared until a redraw.
create plots with more than 1 column (eg, 6 plots in two columns).
With a shared axis box, select two plots on the same row, so you
would expect them to share a Y axis.  
  -the bottom axis is suppresed on both.
    (they should not be)
  -The left axis on the right plot is not suppresed.
    (it should be)
until something is done to trigger a redraw (eg, a rescale) at which 
time the plots are drawn correctly.

Bugs Reported by D.V. Wiebe


2. data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
the user's home directory.

[ Related bug from Nicholas:]
In the data wizard or in the data manager, select the data from a file by giving the path relative to the folder where kst was started. The plot appears without problem. Save the kst file in the same folder where kst was started. Close Kst from the same place and reopen the kst file. It cannot plot the data. But if you go in the data manager and edit a specific vector from the file, it will be plotted.
[cbn: under linux, relative file names don't seem to work at all.]

5. All the dialog boxes appear to be modal now (they block interaction
with the main window while open).  This slows me down significanlly.
(I find I'm constantly opening and closing dialogs)

7. Adding a curve to a plot in the edit plot item dialog, and hitting
"Apply" causes the dialog box to grow wider.  Removing a plot does the
same thing.  The result is an ever-widening dialog box, which can't be
re-narrowed since it believes it is as small as it can get.  (It's the
list of tabs on the left which is doing the growing.)

9. Plotting too many decades in, the x- or y-log axis results in "y-log
base-and-offset mode", giving, say, a base of 100, and tick labels
"-[99.9999]", "[0]", "+[9999900]", "+[1e12]", "+[1e17]" instead of
"0.001", "100", "1000000", "1e12","1e17".  (Although I'd argue that, if
we're going to label in 5 decade intervals, 1e-5, 1, 1e5, 1e10 is
better, and even better than that would be 6 decade intervals: 1e-6, 1,
1e6, 1e12)

11. When in log mode, the range reported in the range tab of the edit
plot item is the logarithm of the range.  So if the y-range is 0.1 to
100, the range will be reported as -1 to 2.  Despite this, you still
have to enter "0.1" and "100" to get this range.

13. Hitting shift changes into y-zoom mode forever, rather than just
changing it while shift is depressed.  After doing this it's difficult
to get back to xy-zoom mode.  (I have to right click twice to open and
close the context menu.)
(cbn says 'not confirmed - more info needed)

----------------

1) Open the „about“ dialog box and click on a link. Nothing happens, everything disappears in the box. If kst was started from the command line, you get:
QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
QTextBrowser: No document for http://kst.kde.org/
(NB/windows.  Confirmed by CBN/linux)

4) When configuring Kst: “Settings>Configure kst” many settings are not taken into account, such as the grid settings, and disappear by the next start of kst.
 (NB/windows.  Under linux, the configuration options are remembered, but not honored until kst is restarted).  Note - Settings are treated as defaults and do
not change created objects.  Ie.  Grid setting will apply to all newly created Tabs, but not existing tabs currently.

5) When starting Kst from a different folder, it creates another kstdatarc in the current folder instead of having one fixed rc file stored somewhere
cbn note: this appears to be masked using the run-kst script - which which sets the cwd to the directory where the script is located (I think).  The kstdatarc file should live in the standard kde config directory (on my machine, this is ~/.kde/share/config, but we need to verify where it is on Windows and Mac.
