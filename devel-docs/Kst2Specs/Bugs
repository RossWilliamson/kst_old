Rounding problems in base/offset mode:
  For extreme cases of base/offset mode there are  rounding errors related to the subtraction of the base.
  Log axis should never go to base offset mode - instead they should use scientific; powers should be relative to 1.

Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

Shared Axis behavioral principles:

"shared axis" means that only the bottom most (for shared X) or the
left most (for shared Y) numbers and labels are shown.

  -All plots have a tied zoom indicator.  All plots indicated as tied will have
   both of their axis tied, regardless if they are shared.  All plots not indicated
   as tied will only have their axis tied if they are shared.

------------------------------
------------ Bugs based on the above principles: --------------

There is no tied zoom indicator for plots in a shared axis box.
There should be.  Its behavior is as follows:
  For axis that are selected to be shared:
    -If any of the plots inside the shared axis box are tied to any plots outside the 
     shared axis box, then the shared axis for all plots in the shared axis box will
     be tied to the tied plots outside.
  For axis that are *not* selected to be shared:
    -The tied zoom for the *unshared* axis behaves exactly as it would if the plot 
     were not in a shared axis box.
 Shared axis boxes do not have tied zoom indicators - only the plots do.

Tied zoom indicator location:
  - If a plot shares *only* an X axis with a plot directly above it:
     The indicator will be to the right of the plot, with its top even with
     the top of the plot.
  - If a plot shares *only* a Y axis with the plot directly to its right:
      The indicator will be above the plot, with its top even with the right 
      of the plot.
  - If a plot shares *both* axis with a plot above and a plot to its right:
      The indicator is not shown - its behavior would be redundant with the
      indicator on the top right corner.
  - If a plot is in a shared axis box which shares both X and Y axis:
      only the plot in the top right corner  (alternativly, only plots which don't 
      share an axis with a plot above or to its right) will show its indicator.  
      The indicator would be redundant, anyway, with the indicator in the top right.

Only absolute file names seem to work. 
  -data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory.

  -In the data wizard or in the data manager, select the data from a file by giving the path relative to the folder where kst was started. The plot appears without problem. Save the kst file in the same folder where kst was started. Close Kst from the same place and reopen the kst file. It cannot plot the data. But if you go in the data manager and edit a specific vector from the file, it will be plotted.
 -[cbn: under linux, relative file names don't seem to work at all.]

------------------------------

Hitting shift changes into y-zoom mode forever, rather than just
changing it while shift is depressed.  After doing this it's difficult
to get back to xy-zoom mode.  (I have to right click twice to open and
close the context menu.)
(cbn says 'not confirmed - more info needed)

----------------

Open the „about“ dialog box and click on a link. Nothing happens, everything disappears in the box. If kst was started from the command line, you get:
QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
QTextBrowser: No document for http://kst.kde.org/
Confirmed by CBN/linux

----------------

Font settings in Settings->General do not appear until, eg, the window is resized.
Plots should be updated upon 'apply'.

----------------

It is not clear from the dialog that grid and color options are defaults for new plots and don't apply to existing
plots.  The text should be modified to make this clear.

----------------

kstdatarc is located relative to the directory from which kst is run.  It should be located in
the standard config directory.  
  For linux under KDE4, this is `kde4-config --localprefix`/share/config/
  For linux, not kde4, consider ~/.kst/
  No idea what it should be for windows or mac.  

---------------------

In the « edit plot item » dialog: the size of this dialog box is not scalable. Problem is that the size is computed with the longest name of all the curves in the plot. And these names can be very long if automatically generated… 
It needs a maximum width

---------------------

   2. “Configure ASCII file” : -it seems that these settings are not saved as global settings, but for each file ! Such that for my 10^5 files having the same format, I have to define 10^5 the same ascii format. It may be useful to have global settings and to overwrite them with settings stored in the .kst files. Note: I informed him that it was possible to edit manually the kstdatarc file to get the desired result, but a global setting UI has to be provided at some point.

   4. Reloading a previously saved kst files seems to forget all the “configure ascii file” settings (in particularly “read fields names from”) so that no vector can be generated because kst tries to read an unknown field! This may explain why the relative path names did not work (see bug reported earlier). In the meantime, it has been confirmed that reloading works with the appropriate kstdatarc file in the right place.

   5. For the « kst --help » I first get the message
“Runtime Error! Program: c:\Program\klst\bin\kst.exe This application has requested the runtim to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

Then kst closes and and I get the help in the console (cygwin) in the windows cmd.exe I don’t get any help…

   6. I did not found an option for forcing the use of a specific kstdatarc file. Meaning that now I’m having a kstdatarc in each folder where I want to start kst.

   7. Even if I don’t modify anything on a kst file (no click at all) kst always ask for saving the changes on closing.

   9. the font resizing does not work so well as in the 1.7. If you resize the windows, the fonts are not resized so well. It may come from the windows fonts. I tried several different fonts but did not succeed to get a clear one. Note: it seems to be somewhat better with the latest changes.
  
10. would it be possible to have the kst file name written in the windows title? (or the current path where you are or something configurable?)
