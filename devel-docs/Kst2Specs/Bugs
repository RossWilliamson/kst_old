Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
  -need escapedName() to supplement name().
  -the name will be stored with escapes.  Name() will remove them.

---------

Tooltips everywhere.
Accelerators everywhere.

---------

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.

----------

Y Axis label placement is wrong
Create a plot with 24 curves from the data wizard.  The Y axis label is offset vertically.

------------

'c' mode doesn't show difference.
'c' mode is used to find the offset from a marker to the cursor.
Currently, if 'c' is hit, a marker is placed, as it should.  However, the difference between the marker and the cursor is not shown anywhere.  See 1.x for the correct behavior.

------------

Plot update problem:
  -from the data wizard create several plots.
  -Make a change to the plot that changes the size of the plot (eg, change the font size.
 The plot you changed is happy, but all of the other plots don't get automatically re-aligned.
  -Move your mouse into one of the plots that is not properly aligned.  
The curve is re-drawn to be aligned with the other curves, but the plot axis is not re-drawn.

------------

Equation update problem
  -Create a curve from a datasource.
  -create an equation from a vector from the curve.
  -Change the input vector (eg, with the 'back one screen' button)
The curve updates, but the equation/equation curve does not.

------------

Image dialog 'smart' range calculations seem to be... odd.
