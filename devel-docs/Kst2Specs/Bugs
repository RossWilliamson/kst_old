------------
Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

------------
Only absolute file names seem to work. 
  -data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory.
Note:  Resolve symlinks is turned on, but ~ is not processed by QDirModel completer.
 -[cbn: under linux, relative file names don't seem to work at all.]

------------------------------

USAGE() does not exit cleanly, so there are issues under windows:
 For the « kst --help » I first get the message
“Runtime Error! Program: c:\Program\klst\bin\kst.exe This application has requested the runtim to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

Then kst closes and and I get the help in the console (cygwin) in the windows cmd.exe I don’t get any help…

Print to pdf is not vector quality... it should be.

--------------------

Print to ps is not vector quality... it should be.
It is also huge!

--------------------

Offset mode doesn't work in data mode.
In a plot in kst, go into data mode.  Then use 'c' to leave a marker.
It is left in the correct place.  Now move the mouse.  The offset to the marker
is not shown, but it should be.  If you leave data mode, then it is.
(behavior should be the same as 1.x).
