Bugs in Build System:
  -picks up libraries in lib/X11 before local libs
  -doesn't support 'make install' nor DESTDIR
---------

Tied zoom problems: (see devel-docs/Kst2Specs/Plot Geometry.pdf, last page).
  -The tied zoom conditions are not honored
  -The parent option condition is not honored.  In fact, there is no way to set parent options, even if there were parent options.
  -The plots are not automatically re-sized to have equal size once the axis are shared.

---------

Missing tabs in plot dialog:
  -There is no tab to manually set plot zoom ranges.  There should be (see 1.x).
*cbn*
---------

Plot axis number rounding bug:
occasionally, the axis numbers can be something like 0.499999999993 instead of 0.5.  It is hard to
reproduce.
*Mike*
---------

Number of major ticks bug:
Occasionally there will be too few (<2) or too many (serious overlap) in the number of major 
ticks.  This seems to have changed from 1.x

---------

Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
*cbn*
---------

No space allocated for subscripts or superscripts in axis lables
  The subscript is cut off

---------

Formatting/spacing issues:
  -Superscript and subscript size and position seems off.  This should be researched more
  but wikipedia as an almost reasonable article on it.  It suggests both should be scaled by ~60%, and subscripts dropped by 16% and superscripts raised by 44%.  OOffice, illustrator, and photoshop use scale 58%, raise 33%, lower 33%.  msoffice uses 65%, -14%, +35%.  It might also pay to compare w/ TeX.

  -The spacing between the X-axis numbers and the axis is too small.
  -The spacing between the Y-axis numbers and the axis doesn't seem to scale with window size.
  -The plot selection buttons are too small.

---------

Edit plot dialog format issue:
The tab list on the left has a minimum size set in pixels, and is not dependent on
the size of the tab names.

---------

Accelerators for the plot edit dialog:
clicking on the plot outside the plot region in zoom mode should bring up the plot edit dialog.
  if on a label, to the label page
  if on the numbers to the axis range page (which doesn't yet exist).

---------

Top Level View needs rmb menu:
  -set background properties (colour, gradient, etc)
  -set tied zoom mode for children (?)
  -cleanup layout menu option
*Mike*
---------

Axis labels are not transparent
Create a plot with X, or Y or Top axis labels.  Change the background of the plot to a gradient.
The axis label backgrounds are still white.  They should be the color of the background (alpha channel?)
*Mike*
---------

Axis labels should have configurable colour.
  A byproduct of making the label backgrounds transparent will be that if the background is set to a colour
  with a low contrast to black (like black, or close to black) the labels will not be visible and there is 
  currently no way to change them.

View Object parents not preserved in saving/loading kst file
  Create a plot.  Put  a box in the plot.  Put a label in the box.
  move the plot around - verify that the box is a child of the plot.
  move the box around - verify that the label is a child of the box.
  save as a .kst file.
  load the kst file
    -note that everything is positioned relative to the tlv, and are all children of the tlv.

---------

Fragility in moving parents:
  create a plot.
  Put a child box in the plot.
  Rapidly resize the plot.  Sometimes the box will either drift or loose parenting altogether.
  (Editorial: Fundamentally, I think this is because qt's QGraphics system has been used to track placement
  of objects, and QGraphics doesn't have the right model of what we are doing.)

---------

Plot dialog label tab has grown out of control!  It should be shrunk to fit in 800x600
It needs to shrink.  
  -There needs to be only one scalar and string selection combos, and they need to apply
  to the most recenly selected label text entry.
  -The per-label font selection needs to be drastically shrunk.
      maybe: only the text and the size active, w/ the info in a label, with a button to edit.
      or maybe: only one font allowed for a plot, and have toggle buttons for U B I.
      or maybe: only one font and UBI combo for a plot.  UBI can be set w/ latex commands in the label.
  -get rid of all the per-item boxes and use more space efficient separators.

*Mike*
---------

Missing features in edit label label dialog:
  there is no mechanism to adjust the font, or Underline Bold Italics (UBI) in the edit label dialog.
*Mike*
---------

The entire edit label properties tab should be shown when creating a label, not just the label text and the
string/scalar selections (ie, incude size, font, UBI, and colour.)
*Mike*
---------

Labels should have configurable font and UBI.
*Mike*
---------

Tooltips everywhere.

---------

Labels drawn outside of PlotItem region.
  With inappropriately sized PlotItem's the labels / axis / etc are occasionally drawn outside of the PlotItem.
  Anything drawn outside of the item is not cleaned up by the item and remains until the view invalidates it, these
  remnants are common when creating plots from the layout mode.
  Additional checks should be added to provide drawing of items that extend outside of the PlotItem.

----------

With multiple plots, when zooming one changes the size properties of
another (due to axis label changes, for example), the axes labels on the
non-modified plot(s) can get garbled until the mouse is moved over them.

----------

When displaying data that is constant, the range is from about zero to slightly
above the curve (meaning the curve is very near the top of the plot.
instead, it should center the curve and have a range of ±0.1 around the constant
value.

----------

Double clicking on a curve in zoom mode should bring up the edit curve dialog (was in 1.x, 
but was a little buggy).

----------

Data mode (see 1.x) should be implemented

----------
 
Reference point (see 1.x, 'c')  should be implemented.

----------
 
Export as png with a set width and height shows transparency (blank)
where extra space is, rather than resizing the view for the export.

----------
 
Kst should ask about saving the .kst file on exit if the document has changed
(basically, any change other than a mouse/arrow zoom).  See 1.x.

----------
 
.kst should be appended to the name of a .kst file if it is not already there.

---------

kst reads live dirfiles less efficiently than before.  On a shitty
computer (devlin666), kst1.7 can display 200 frames of 24 bolometer
channels (100Hz samples; 20 samples per frame) with a 500ms kst update
timer, and only use about 20% of the cpu and the computer will still
seem 'responsive enough'.  kst2 under the same conditions, except with
2000ms kst update timer uses about 55% of the cpu and the computer (and
kst) seem more sluggish.  

---------

datawizard generated multiple plots per view have the font size for
the lables way too big (so big that, in the case of 24 plots), the axis
labels take up >75% of the real estate.  The wizard should chose the font
based on the number of plots that will be in the tlv when finished.

--------

kst settings dialogue box should select "General" when first opened
to indicate that what we're seeing to the right is the General tab.

--------

The first pane of the data wizard should be reading directories in
the background, instead of in the foreground where it steals X focus
until the directory is read.  I ran into a interminable-focus-stealing
problem where kst was attempting to read a dead NFS mount.  Required an
X restart.

--------

No way to cancel a drawing command.
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box)
  Change your mind.... tough - you have to draw something.

--------

No visible feedback as to what drawing mode you are in...
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box).  There is no visible indication
  that you just selected a drawing tool.  The tool should be clearly shown 
  either with the toolbar icon remaining depressed until the action is finished, 
  or in the mouse icon.
