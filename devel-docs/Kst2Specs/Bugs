Zoom Mode Plot Bugs:
  -Zooming does not work if there are no curves in the plots.  It should.

  -Zooming gets slower the more points there are in the curves. It should
  always be fast.


Zoom lines are left:
what happens:
  Put the mouse in a plot and depress <ctrl>.  A vertical line appears
  where the mouse is.  Move the mouse around.  The line follows the mouse.
  Now release <ctrl>.  The line stays.
What should happen:
  The line should disappear when <ctrl> is released.
