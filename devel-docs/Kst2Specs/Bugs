Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
  -need escapedName() to supplement name().
  -the name will be stored with escapes.  Name() will remove them.

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.

---------

Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** I think this is because my kst window, for some reason, is resizing.**

---------

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.

------------

Error in choice of offset mode.
Create a plot with a Y range from -0.032 to 0.041.  It goes into base/offset mode and shouldn't.

------------

Drawing problems in resizing arrow
draw an arrow.  In layout mode, grab one end and drag it around.  The grab point
gradually drifts away from the mouse cursor.

------------

'ok' in arrow dialog moves the arrow.
draw an arrow. Open the edit dialog.  change something and hit apply.  The arrow moves.

------------

Image dialog 'smart' range calculations seem to be... odd.

------------

Layout issues in data object dialogs:
  some dialogs, like histogram, lines up nicely, while others, like image
  is excessivly indented.  I can't see any difference in their implementation.,

------------

Shared axis zoom usage problem:
Create a shared axis zoom box with multiple plots in a column.
  -there is no option to indicate or change whether the plots are tied.

Zoom into one of them.
  -All plots do exactly the same zoom, as if they were tied.

Correct behavior:
  -There should still be tied zoom indicators.
  -If the tied zoom indicators are not checked, then the shared axis 
  should behave as if it were tied, but the other should not.
  -If the tied zoom indicators are checked, then it should tie both axis.
