Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.

kst reads live dirfiles less efficiently than before. �On a shitty
computer (devlin666), kst1.7 can display 200 frames of 24 bolometer
channels (100Hz samples; 20 samples per frame) with a 500ms kst update
timer, and only use about 20% of the cpu and the computer will still
seem 'responsive enough'. �kst2 under the same conditions, except with
2000ms kst update timer uses about 55% of the cpu and the computer (and
kst) seem more sluggish. �

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.

Base / Offset / Rotation of Axis Labels based on discussion.

Here's the possible changes

#1.   Ability to rotate axis labels.  Axis numbers could be rotated in
1.x but cannot in 2.0.

#2.  Change Base/Offset Mode to radio box set for On (same as current)
Auto (same as current off) Off (new mode in which it will never
automatically switch and will truncate if settings are inappropriate.)

#2b.  Update behaviour only for interpreted axis where off makes it
possible to not use base offset mode, but that would also require #1 as
it would never fit as is.

#3.  Kst 1.x also had the ability to set the justification for the top
label, but we currently do not that option for labels in 2.0.
