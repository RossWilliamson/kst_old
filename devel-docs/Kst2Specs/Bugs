Crash Case: crash second time opening config dialog.
Start kst.
Open the configuration dialog (settings->configure kst), close it, then open it again.
Crash!

---------

Rounding problems in base/offset mode:
  Log axis should never go to base offset mode - instead they should use scientific; powers should be relative to 1.
   - LogAxis are now using only two significant digits so that scientific notation is used by default.

---------

Plot sizes are not properly recovered on re-load
Create a plot in kst.  Cleanup Layout->automatic
 -the plot now ~fills the window.
save it.
load it
  -the plot is now smaller than it was.
It should be the same size as it started.
** it is now much better than it used to be.  The shift is now only a few pixels **
** low priority **

------------
Only absolute file names seem to work. 
  -data source text box doesn't recognise initial ~ as a euphemism for
   the user's home directory.

 -In the data wizard or in the data manager, select the data from a file by giving the path 
  relative to the folder where kst was started. The plot appears without problem. Save the 
  kst file in the same folder where kst was started. Close Kst from the same place and reopen 
  the kst file. It cannot plot the data. But if you go in the data manager and edit a specific 
  vector from the file, it will be plotted.
 -[cbn: under linux, relative file names don't seem to work at all.]

------------------------------

Hitting shift changes into y-zoom mode forever, rather than just
changing it while shift is depressed.  After doing this it's difficult
to get back to xy-zoom mode.  (I have to right click twice to open and
close the context menu.)
(cbn says 'not confirmed - more info needed)

--------------------

USAGE() does not exit cleanly, so there are issues under windows:
 For the « kst --help » I first get the message
“Runtime Error! Program: c:\Program\klst\bin\kst.exe This application has requested the runtim to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

Then kst closes and and I get the help in the console (cygwin) in the windows cmd.exe I don’t get any help…
