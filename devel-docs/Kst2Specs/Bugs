Zoom Mode Plot Bugs:

In base offset mode, sometimes the tick rounding is strange: for example, around 99999.5, you may have ticks
at 0.0004999999995 and 0.000500000009 (instead of +-0.0005).

General bugs:

-Startup is very slow.

-The drag box is very slow, uses 100% cpu, and lags behind the mouse.
