Equation update problem
  -Create a curve from a datasource.
  -create an equation from a vector from the curve.
  -Change the input vector (eg, with the 'back one screen' button)
The curve updates, but the equation/equation curve does not.

------------

Plot is not regenerated after 'ok' in the plot dialog axis tabs makes a visual change. 
 -create a plot.
 -in the plot dialog axis tab change something (eg, the 'draw grid lines' option) and hit 'ok'.
The plot is not redrawn to honor this change.  (if you do something else to force a
redraw, the change is displayed.)

-------------

Loading a kst file does not seem to work at all:
  -run kst
  -with the wizard, make a plot with three curves
  -save it.
  -restart kst, loading the file from the command line (./run-kst tmp.kst)
 kst gives an 'invalid Tag' error, and no plots are shown.

---------------TO BE DONE AFTER BETA--------------------------------


Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
  -need escapedName() to supplement name().
  -the name will be stored with escapes.  Name() will remove them.

---------

Tooltips/whats this where helpful.
Accelerators everywhere.

---------

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.

------------

Error in choice of offset mode.
Create a plot with a Y range from -0.032 to 0.041.  It goes into base/offset mode and shouldn't.

------------

Drawing problems in resizing arrow
draw an arrow.  In layout mode, grab one end and drag it around.  There are drawing artifacts left.

------------

'ok' in arrow dialog moves the arrow.
draw an arrow. Open the edit dialog.  change something and hit apply.  The arrow moves.

------------

Image dialog 'smart' range calculations seem to be... odd.
