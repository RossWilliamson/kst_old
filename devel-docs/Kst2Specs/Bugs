Tied zoom problems: (see devel-docs/Kst2Specs/Plot Geometry.pdf, last page).
  -The tied zoom conditions are not honored
  -The parent option condition is not honored.  In fact, there is no way to set parent options, even if there were parent options.
  -The plots are not automatically re-sized to have equal size once the axis are shared.

Missing tabs in plot dialog:
  -There is no tab to manually set plot zoom ranges.  There should be (see 1.x).

Plot axis number rounding bug:
occasionally, the axis numbers can be something like 0.499999999993 instead of 0.5.  It is hard to
reproduce.

---------

Number of major ticks bug:
Occasionally there will be too few (<2) or too many (serious overlap) in the number of major 
ticks.  This seems to have changed from 1.x

---------

Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.
*cbn*
---------

No space allocated for subscripts or superscripts in axis lables
  The subscript is cut off

---------

Formatting/spacing issues:
  -Superscript and subscript size and position seems off.  This should be researched more
  but wikipedia as an almost reasonable article on it.  It suggests both should be scaled by ~60%, and subscripts dropped by 16% and superscripts raised by 44%.  OOffice, illustrator, and photoshop use scale 58%, raise 33%, lower 33%.  msoffice uses 65%, -14%, +35%.  It might also pay to compare w/ TeX.

  -The spacing between the X-axis numbers and the axis is too small.
  -The spacing between the Y-axis numbers and the axis doesn't seem to scale with window size.
  -The plot selection buttons are too small.

---------

Edit plot dialog format issue:
The tab list on the left has a minimum size set in pixels, and is not dependent on
the size of the tab names.

---------

Accelerators for the plot edit dialog:
clicking on the plot outside the plot region in zoom mode should bring up the plot edit dialog.
  if on a label, to the label page
  if on the numbers to the axis range page (which doesn't yet exist).

---------

Top Level View needs rmb menu:
  -set background properties (colour, gradient, etc)
  -set tied zoom mode for children (?)
  -cleanup layout menu option

---------

Axis labels are not transparent
Create a plot with X, or Y or Top axis labels.  Change the background of the plot to a gradient.
The axis label backgrounds are still white.  They should be the color of the background (alpha channel?)

---------

View Object parents not preserved in saving/loading kst file
  Create a plot.  Put  a box in the plot.  Put a label in the box.
  move the plot around - verify that the box is a child of the plot.
  move the box around - verify that the label is a child of the box.
  save as a .kst file.
  load the kst file
    -note that everything is positioned relative to the tlv, and are all children of the tlv.

---------

Fragility in moving parents:
  create a plot.
  Put a child box in the plot.
  Rapidly resize the plot.  Sometimes the box will either drift or loose parenting altogether.
  (Editorial: Fundamentally, I think this is because qt's QGraphics system has been used to track placement
  of objects, and QGraphics doesn't have the right model of what we are doing.)

---------

Plot dialog label tab has grown out of control!  It should be shrunk to fit in 800x600
It needs to shrink.  
  -There needs to be only one scalar and string selection combos, and they need to apply
  to the most recenly selected label text entry.
  -The per-label font selection needs to be drastically shrunk.
      maybe: only the text and the size active, w/ the info in a label, with a button to edit.
      or maybe: only one font allowed for a plot, and have toggle buttons for U B I.
      or maybe: only one font and UBI combo for a plot.  UBI can be set w/ latex commands in the label.
  -get rid of all the per-item boxes and use more space efficient separators.

---------

Missing features in edit label label dialog:
  there is no mechanism to adjust the font, or Underline Bold Italics (UBI) in the edit label dialog.
  
---------

The entire edit label properties tab should be shown when creating a label, not just the label text and the
string/scalar selections (ie, incude size, font, UBI, and colour.)

---------

Tooltips everywhere.
