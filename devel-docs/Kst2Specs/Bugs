Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
There needs to be an option to somehow escape these when using them in a label.

Tooltips everywhere.

With multiple plots, when zooming one changes the size properties of
another (due to axis label changes, for example), the axes labels on the
non-modified plot(s) can get garbled until the mouse is moved over them.

kst reads live dirfiles less efficiently than before. �On a shitty
computer (devlin666), kst1.7 can display 200 frames of 24 bolometer
channels (100Hz samples; 20 samples per frame) with a 500ms kst update
timer, and only use about 20% of the cpu and the computer will still
seem 'responsive enough'. �kst2 under the same conditions, except with
2000ms kst update timer uses about 55% of the cpu and the computer (and
kst) seem more sluggish. �

PlotMarginStandardization is applied inconsistently.
- Note: Fixed many cases.  After applying layout, plotBorders are set to Dirty, this may not be
correct.  A number of margins are not updated within the changed plot currently preventing full
validation.

SharedAxisBox plot sharing occasionally breaks for no apparent reason.
Have not identified a pattern or cause as of yet.

Fragility in moving parents:
  create a plot.
  Put a child box in the plot.
  Rapidly resize the plot.  Sometimes the box will either drift or loose parenting altogether.
  (Editorial: Fundamentally, I think this is because qt's QGraphics system has been used to track placement
  of objects, and QGraphics doesn't have the right model of what we are doing.)

  Note:  This is still causing parenting to fail.  Updates are required to prevent reparenting on parent resize.
