Drag and Drop    (George for all of this)
-------------

- Factories need to register earlier and automatically for each view object type
- Rename plots that cause namespace conflicts
- DCOP ID needs to be stored for callback
- Callback for objects that we need
- Drag across processes
- Drop target rect
- Feedback on errors


Objects
-------
- undo/redo
	- must use the marshalling code
- draw(QPainter&, ...) needs to be rethought slightly in Kst2DPlot and pushed
  up the chain.


Integration
-----------
- Concept of "New" might need to change


Fun Stuff
---------
- Provide alternate drag mimetypes?
	- maybe even XML?
- Opaque move
- Stored drag should write a signature, and then drags can be dropped on the
  desktop into a file and then dragged to a Kst window another time.
  	- This conflicts with image dropping.
